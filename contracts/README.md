# Gloam Contracts

Live on Robinhood Chain mainnet (`4663`) and Tempo mainnet (`4217`) since 21 October 2026 and on Base mainnet (`8453`) and Ethereum mainnet (`1`) since 26 October 2026, in beta, with `ShieldPoolPayments` on the trusted setup's final keys, and on the testnets (Robinhood Chain `46630`, Tempo `42431`) on dev keys. Base Sepolia (`84532`) and Ethereum Sepolia (`11155111`) are testnets on the mainnet deploy and the final keys. The mainnet deploy (`script/DeployRobinhoodMainnet.s.sol`, `script/DeployTempoMainnet.s.sol`, `script/DeployBaseMainnet.s.sol`, `script/DeployEthereumMainnet.s.sol`) uses the final keys in `src/verifiers/final` and checks them on chain before it creates the pool; see [`PRODUCTION.md`](./PRODUCTION.md). Mainnet is beta software: reviewed internally (20 October 2026, no Critical or High findings open), and Kann Audits reviewed the vault contracts (report, 1 November 2026: gloam.trade/security) and found no Critical, High or Medium issues.

## Do we need contracts?

| Path | Contracts |
| --- | --- |
| Send ETH / ERC-20 | No — native + faucet tokens |
| Public swap (when pools exist) | No — existing DEX router |
| **Shield / private send / private trade / cash out** | **Yes — this package** |

## Live (mainnet, beta)

| Base mainnet `8453` | `0x39E28Cde55CAB798874746ac52cb4B5Cc99a0194` | `53109632` | `0x1a32C2c2A77225EC2dD3BF7be1018819b1039Cb4` |
| Ethereum mainnet `1` | `0x39E28Cde55CAB798874746ac52cb4B5Cc99a0194` | `26276183` | `0x1a32C2c2A77225EC2dD3BF7be1018819b1039Cb4` |

- Owner: `0x76b7E410a227c888aBD2Bdc24Ee32E094B0FD4D8` (one wallet; a multisig is planned), until [`VaultOwnerGuard`](./src/VaultOwnerGuard.sol) takes over a vault: it forwards only limit and fee changes and the sweep of stray native coin, so `setVerifier` can never run again there. Read `owner()` on a vault to see which holds it; the runbook is the owner guard section of [`DEPLOY.md`](../DEPLOY.md). Fee recipient: the treasury `0xB3900ac9350903218e4c7597bAb0f008F01B30B8` since 24 October 2026 (it was the owner at launch; the change waited the 3-day timelock). Relayer: `0xb1E994586E62994648a0b866BF33F2EDd942512e` (run by the Gloam team; it only submits already-proven transactions and pays gas, and cannot move or redirect money).
- Assets and beta deposit limits (per deposit / total): Robinhood Chain USDG `0x5fc5360D0400a0Fd4f2af552ADD042D716F1d168` (500 / 25,000) and $GLOAM `0xDcD885F5c60b3aD49F6D58718696417314e8724d` (25,000 / 250,000); Tempo USDC.e `0x20c000000000000000000000b9537d11c60e8b50`, pathUSD `0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000000`, USDT0 `0x20c00000000000000000000014f22ca97301eb73` and OUSD `0x20c0000000000000000000006a37da5c996874be` (500 / 25,000 each); Base USDC, EURC and USDT (500 / 25,000 each) and ETH (0.2 / 10); Ethereum USDC, USDT, USDG, PYUSD and EURC (500 / 25,000 each) and ETH (0.2 / 10). Full addresses are in `deployments/base-mainnet.json` and `deployments/ethereum-mainnet.json`. ETH is gas only on Robinhood Chain, not a pool asset. A 100x raise of the beta limits is queued behind the timelock for around 1 November 2026.
- Deposits and private transfers are free; `unshield` keeps 0.5% on the mainnet vaults (`withdrawFeeBps = 50`, up from 25 on 3 November 2026 through the timelock) for the fee recipient, at the rate on the day it lands. Base Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia stay at 25. Withdrawals and private transfers are never limited. Raising a limit, listing an asset or raising the fee takes the 3-day timelock; lowering a limit or the fee is instant.
- Payment-memo boards (`GloamPayMemo`, deployed 23 October 2026): Robinhood Chain `0x01B3172d9900Cb26d57E986429b9b23854c74598` (block `95494392`), Tempo `0x342E3745967FDB4223902E196Ceb792c15d8C1c4` (block `45417629`); deployed 26 October 2026: Base `0xfCa1887e77f738ef9C5751974b3f3873d029F2DC` (block `53109729`), Ethereum `0x8699D015087dE6D25d55d5ceB63b34b9d773f135` (block `26276234`). Verifier addresses: read `verifier()` and `shieldVerifier()` on the pool.

## Base: Base Sepolia live, Base mainnet next

Base Sepolia (`84532`) and Base mainnet (`8453`) run the same `ShieldPoolPayments` deploy as the mainnets, on the final keys: `script/DeployBaseSepolia.s.sol` and `script/DeployBaseMainnet.s.sol`, both through `script/MainnetDeploy.sol` with native ETH allowed. Assets: USDC, EURC and ETH on both, plus bridged USDT on Base mainnet; 500 / 25,000 per stablecoin and 0.2 / 10 ETH. The runbook is [`DEPLOY-BASE.md`](../DEPLOY-BASE.md).

| Base Sepolia `84532` (testnet, live since 24 October 2026) | `0x39e28cde55cab798874746ac52cb4b5cc99a0194` | `49802958` | `0x01B3172d9900Cb26d57E986429b9b23854c74598` |
| Base mainnet `8453` | not deployed yet | | |

Base Sepolia record (verifiers, assets, owner, fee recipient): [deployments/base-sepolia.json](./deployments/base-sepolia.json).

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Shield / unshield / transfer | Live on mainnet (final keys, beta deposit limits, 0.5% cash-out fee) and testnet (dev keys); no admin withdraw, 3-day timelock on rule changes |
| Sealed private trade | Built, switched off on the testnet pools and left out of the mainnet pool (`ShieldPoolPayments`); must not be re-enabled until the H1 and ZK-1 fixes land (see audit/REMEDIATION.md) |
| Pay memos | Live on the mainnets and the testnets |
| Production keys | Done: the 13-contributor ceremony's final keys (drand round 6561386, release `ceremony-final`) in `src/verifiers/final`, used on mainnet |

## Ethereum: Ethereum Sepolia live, Ethereum mainnet next

Ethereum mainnet (`1`) runs the same `ShieldPoolPayments` deploy on the final keys: `script/DeployEthereumMainnet.s.sol`, through `script/MainnetDeploy.sol` with native ETH allowed. Assets: USDC, USDT, USDG, PYUSD and EURC (500 / 25,000 each) and ETH (0.2 / 10). A fork test (`test/fork/EthereumMainnetFork.t.sol`, `ETH_FORK=1`) puts real USDT and ETH through the vault with final-key proofs. The runbook is [`DEPLOY-ETHEREUM.md`](../DEPLOY-ETHEREUM.md). Ethereum Sepolia (`script/DeployEthereumSepolia.s.sol`, runbook [`DEPLOY-ETHEREUM-SEPOLIA.md`](../DEPLOY-ETHEREUM-SEPOLIA.md)) runs the same deploy with test USDC, USDG, PYUSD, EURC and ETH.

## Honesty

- No mock “private success” in the app.
- Public app paths work without this package.
- Dev ceremony zkeys on the testnets only; mainnet runs on the final keys. Never use dev keys on mainnet.
