/**
 * Gloam on Ethereum mainnet (chainId 1): the payments pool with beta deposit
 * limits. The deploy itself is MainnetDeploy, shared with Robinhood Chain, Tempo
 * and Base, so every chain gets the same pool wired the same way. Ethereum
 * Sepolia, its testnet, runs this same deploy first (DeployEthereumSepolia.s.sol).
 *
 * The USER runs this. It is NOT executed by CI or by any agent. Runbook: DEPLOY-ETHEREUM.md.
 *
 * Before running:
 *   1. Keys: the script deploys the ceremony-final verifiers (src/verifiers/final)
 *      and refuses to create the pool unless they accept final-key proofs and
 *      reject dev-key ones (MainnetDeploy._requireCeremonyKeys).
 *   2. Deploy PoseidonT3 only:  POSEIDON_T3_ONLY=1 node circuits/scripts/deploy-poseidon.mjs
 *      From a deployer with no transactions on Ethereum that lands at
 *      0x1a32C2c2A77225EC2dD3BF7be1018819b1039Cb4 and this script's pool at
 *      0x39e28cde55cab798874746ac52cb4b5cc99a0194, the same as on the other chains.

 *
 * Run (Ethereum blocks hold 60M gas; the largest call here, the pool, is about
 * 11.9 KB of code, under the 24 KB limit). Gas is the real cost on Ethereum:
 * check the price first and cap what forge may pay (DEPLOY-ETHEREUM.md). Dry run first, then:
 *   forge script script/DeployEthereumMainnet.s.sol:DeployEthereumMainnet --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
 *     --broadcast --slow --with-gas-price 2gwei --priority-gas-price 0.01gwei
 *
 * USDT's approve() refuses to change one non-zero allowance into another and
 * returns nothing; the pool pulls and pays out with low-level calls that accept
 * no return data, and the app resets a stale USDT allowance to 0 before
 * approving a deposit. A fee on USDT transfers (off today, Tether can turn it
 * on) would make every USDT deposit revert with FeeOnTransferNotSupported:
 * nothing is taken, nothing is stuck.
 *
 * After: record the pool address and deploy block in MAINNET_POOLS[1]
 * (app/src/lib/mainnet.ts and packages/sdk/src/mainnet.ts).
