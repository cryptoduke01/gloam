 * Gloam on Base mainnet (chainId 8453): the payments pool with beta deposit
 * limits. The deploy itself is MainnetDeploy, shared with Robinhood Chain and
 * Tempo, so all three chains get the same pool wired the same way. Run it only
 * after the same deploy has been tested end to end on Base Sepolia
 * (DeployBaseSepolia.s.sol).
 *
 * The USER runs this. It is NOT executed by CI or by any agent. Runbook: DEPLOY-BASE.md.
 *
 * Before running:
 *   1. Keys: the script deploys the ceremony-final verifiers (src/verifiers/final)
 *      and refuses to create the pool unless they accept final-key proofs and
 *      reject dev-key ones (MainnetDeploy._requireCeremonyKeys).
 *   2. Deploy PoseidonT3 only:  POSEIDON_T3_ONLY=1 node circuits/scripts/deploy-poseidon.mjs
 *      From a deployer with no transactions on Base that lands at
 *      0x1a32C2c2A77225EC2dD3BF7be1018819b1039Cb4 and this script's pool at
 *      0x39e28cde55cab798874746ac52cb4b5cc99a0194, the same as Robinhood Chain and Tempo.
