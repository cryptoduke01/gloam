/**
 * Deploys VaultOwnerGuard at one address on all four mainnets. The runbook is
 * the owner guard section of DEPLOY.md.
 *
 * The USER runs this. It is NOT executed by CI or by any agent. Deploying moves
 * no ownership: the guard does nothing until the vault's owner offers it the
 * vault and the controller accepts (contracts/launch/guard.html).
 *
 * Same address everywhere: the deployer's nonce differs per chain (19, 20, 19,
 * 21 when this was written), so a plain CREATE cannot match. The script calls
 * the canonical CREATE2 factory (0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C, the
 * same code on all four) itself, rather than `new X{salt: ...}`: forge routes
 * that through the factory on three of the four chains, but not when it
 * simulates Base. The address depends only on the salt and the init code, so
 * any compiler setting or source change moves it: compile from one commit for
 * all four. A deploy from someone else's key lands the same contract with the
 * same controller, so the script accepts a guard already there once it checks out.
 *
 * Any time, no key, nothing sent (the address, and where each chain stands):
 *   forge script script/DeployVaultOwnerGuard.s.sol:DeployVaultOwnerGuard \
 *     --sig "status()" --rpc-url <RPC>
 *
 * Deploy. --interactives 1 makes forge ask for the key once; nothing is stored,
 * and no key belongs in a file or an env var. Any funded account can send it;
 * use the deployer, 0x891E74a11abC5D0eC2EE855B2BD521fF9D18F411. Forge simulates
 * the run first and sends nothing if a check fails. Without --broadcast this is
 * a dry run that needs no key.
 *   forge script script/DeployVaultOwnerGuard.s.sol:DeployVaultOwnerGuard \
 *     --rpc-url <RPC> --sender 0x891E74a11abC5D0eC2EE855B2BD521fF9D18F411 \
 *     --interactives 1 --broadcast --slow
 *
 * After the owner's handover on that chain, this fails unless it landed right:
 *   forge script script/DeployVaultOwnerGuard.s.sol:DeployVaultOwnerGuard \
 *     --sig "check()" --rpc-url <RPC>
 *
