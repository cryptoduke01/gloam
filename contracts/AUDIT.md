# Contract audit notes (Phase 1)

Date: 2026-07-14 · Scope: `ShieldPool` + `IncrementalMerkleTree` · Not a formal third-party audit.

## Intentional limitations (Phase 2)

| Item | Risk if ignored | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proof public inputs = root + nullifier only | Verifier that always returns true allows **arbitrary unshield** | **Do not set mock verifier on a funded pool** |
| Amount/asset not bound in proof | Wrong-amount unshield if verifier is weak | Phase 2 circuits |
| Keccak Merkle vs Poseidon | Circuit mismatch later | Documented; swap hash in library later |
| `emergencyWithdraw` | Owner can drain | Testnet recovery; renounce before trust assumptions |

## Fixed in this pass

- Fee-on-transfer ERC-20 rejected (balance delta check)
- Safe ERC-20 call pattern (return data handling)
- Deploy docs: default verifier `address(0)` locks private exits
- Owner emergency withdraw for testnet recovery
- Tests: emergency withdraw, no-verifier unshield blocked

## Deploy checklist

1. `forge test` green  
2. `DEPLOYER_PK` funded on chain **46630**  
3. Deploy with **no** verifier unless production-grade  
4. Record address in `deployments/testnet.json`  
5. Do **not** open Shield UI deposit until you accept stuck-funds risk (no unshield without verifier) or ship Phase 2  

## Out of scope

Frontend, DEX routers, faucet tokens, mainnet.
