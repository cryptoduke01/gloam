/**
 * @title GloamVaultSwap2
 * @notice The next private swap through a live Gloam vault, in one transaction:
 *         take one note out of the vault, buy an exact amount of another asset
 *         on a DEX, and put that amount back into the vault as a new note. Who
 *         swapped stays private: the note spent and the note made are both
 *         unlinkable to a wallet, and the Gloam relay submits the call. The
 *         amounts are public, as on any DEX trade.
 *
 * What is new against GloamVaultSwap, whose rules all still hold:
 *  - Native ETH. A note may be native ETH (asset address(0)) on either side.
 *  - A way out. Each swap names a one-time exit key in its escrow key, and money
 *    waiting at the swap's escrow can leave to an address that key signs for.
 *
 * What binds what. The vault's unshield proof has one free public input, `to`.
 * A swap sets it to an escrow address that CREATE2 derives from everything the
 * swap must do: the note spent (nullifier, amount), the new note (commitment,
 * asset, amount), a refund note (commitment, amount), the route and the exit
 * key. So:
 *  - only the note's owner can start a swap (the proof needs its secret);
 *  - a caller who copies the call and changes the new note, the refund note,
 *    the route or the exit key gets a different escrow, and the vault rejects
 *    the proof;
 *  - no two notes ever share an escrow;
 *  - the new note's shield proof binds it to exactly `amountOut` of the asset.
 *
 * If someone sends the unshield alone (the proof is public once broadcast),
 * the money waits at the escrow, which only this router can open. The same
 * swap call then sees the note already spent and puts the money back into the
 * vault as the owner's refund note, made beforehand for what is sure to have
 * arrived (the note's amount less the vault's highest possible fee). That call
 * needs only the refund note's proof: the spend's proof and root and the new
 * note's proof are not used on that path.
 *
 * The refund note is a deposit, so it takes room under the vault's limit for
 * the asset, and the vault can't exempt it. While that limit is full the money
 * would wait. exit() is the way out for that case, and for any other that keeps
 * a refund from landing: the holder of the exit key signs for an address, and
 * the whole escrow goes there, in the clear. The exit key is a throwaway address
 * made for this one swap from a secret only the note's owner has, so it says
 * nothing about who that is, and nothing in a swap's proofs or calldata can sign
 * for it. The escrow opens once, so a refund and an exit can never both happen.
 * Nothing about an exit is private: it pays a public address the amount that
 * left the note, which is why the refund stays the normal way back.
 *
 * Leftovers (the input the swap did not need, any extra output, anything sent
 * here by mistake) go to the immutable treasury when it can receive them. A
 * treasury the token issuer blocks never stops a swap or a refund: what it
 * can't take stays here, and every amount a swap uses is measured as a change
 * in balance, so it is never spent on anyone's behalf. Every approval is set
 * back to zero. No upgrade, and no one can move what passes through.
