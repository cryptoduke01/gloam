/**
 * @title GloamVaultSwapV4c
 * @notice Vault swaps on Uniswap v4, third version: any pair of vault assets
 *         joined by allowed pools, up to three hops, with native ETH notes and
 *         WETH notes both. The allowlist and its governance are GloamVaultSwapV4b's.
 *         GloamVaultSwap2 has the escrow key, the refund note, the exit, leftovers
 *         to the treasury and the reentrancy latch.
 *
 * ETH. The vault may hold native ETH (asset address(0)), WETH, or both, as two
 * different assets. A pool may hold either one too, and either note can use
 * either pool: when a note's first pool holds only the other form, the router
 * converts exactly what that pool asks; when a route ends in the other form from
 * the new note, the router converts all of it. Both follow from the route alone,
 * so the escrow key's route hash fixes them too. Inside a route a currency nets
 * to zero in the PoolManager as before, so a middle ETH never leaves it.
 *
 * Pools. A route may use only pools on the allowlist. The constructor's pools
 * are live at once (the deploy itself is the public notice, as with v1). After
 * that the owner can add a pool only by queueing it: it is usable POOL_DELAY
 * after queueing, and the queue is public (PoolQueued, poolLiveAt). The owner
 * can remove a pool, live or queued, at once. The owner has no other power:
 * no function moves tokens, sets an approval, or changes the vault, the
 * treasury, the PoolManager or WETH, which are all immutable.
 *
 * What a bad pool can do (a hostile hook, or a pool priced against the swap).
 * Each swap names its route in its escrow key, so no pool added later can be
 * slipped into a swap someone already proved. On the routes it is on:
 *  - The new note is always exactly `d.amount` of `d.asset`: its shield proof
 *    binds it, and the swap reverts unless the router holds at least that much
 *    of the output it took.
 *  - The router pays at most what the note brought in (the note's amount less
 *    the vault's fee), and reverts whole above that: the note stays unspent.
 *    So the worst a pool can take is the swap's leftover, the price buffer that
 *    would otherwise go to the treasury. Never another note, never the vault.
 *  - The router gives no approval to any pool, hook or the PoolManager: it pays
 *    by transfer, exactly what the deltas say, and a PoolManager that doesn't
 *    net to zero reverts the whole swap.
 *  - A pool or hook that reverts, or is removed, stops only swaps that route
 *    through it. The refund path and the exit never touch a pool, so money sent
 *    to an escrow comes back whatever the allowlist says.
