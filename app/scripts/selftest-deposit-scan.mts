/**
 * Self-test: the vault view's chain reads (26 Oct 2026, perf).
 *
 * 1. A wallet's deposits (its Shielded logs) are read from the deploy block
 *    once per tab; after that only the blocks since the saved part, which
 *    ends RESCAN_OVERLAP blocks below the head it was read at. On Tempo
 *    testnet the full walk was about 40 log reads on every load.
 *    - the rows equal a full walk's, in the same order, after new deposits;
 *    - a deposit in the newest blocks is read again, never only remembered;
 *    - a saved part for another chain, vault or wallet, or one that does not
 *      parse, is never used;
 *    - two callers at once share one read.
 * 2. The spent checks ask about every note at once (one batch) instead of one
 *    read after another, and keep the old rule: only notes with a secret and a
 *    nullifier, on this chain and vault, not already spent here; a `true`
 *    marks the note spent, a failed read leaves it as it is.
 *
 * Run from app/:  ../mcp/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/selftest-deposit-scan.mts
