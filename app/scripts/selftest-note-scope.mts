/**
 * Self-test: notes are matched on chain AND vault, never the vault alone
 * (Duke's report, 25 Oct 2026).
 *
 * With the network set to Base (testnet), the Portfolio showed "Private
 * balance 249.239539 USDG": his Robinhood Chain mainnet notes (35, 214.229539
 * and 0.01 USDG). The Robinhood Chain and Tempo mainnet vaults and the Base
 * Sepolia vault sit at one address, so a switch from Robinhood Chain mainnet to
 * Base Sepolia changed neither the wallet nor the vault address, and the notes
 * hook (which re-read on those two only) kept showing, and offering, the notes
 * it had read for 4663. The tree hook never re-synced on a switch either, so a
 * stale note came with a stale tree: a valid Robinhood Chain proof made while
 * the page showed Base Sepolia.
 *
 * Here: notes of 4663 (and of Base mainnet and Ethereum, which will share the
 * address) sit in the store while 84532 is active. None is shown, counted or
 * spendable; every spend path refuses them before proving; a tree of another
 * chain is never handed out or built through another chain's client; and lib
 * code follows the network the page shows even when storage refuses the write.
 *
 * Run from app/:  ../mcp/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/selftest-note-scope.mts
