/**
 * Self-test: on Base, where the vault lists native ETH, adding ETH privately
 * and cashing it out show in Activity like a token's. Activity on a payments
 * vault was read from ERC-20 Transfer logs only, and a native-coin deposit or
 * cash-out leaves none, so "Added 100 USDC" showed and "Added 0.1 ETH" never
 * did. Now the vault's own Shielded and Unshielded events for the wallet are
 * read too, a cash-out net of the vault's fee (what the wallet received).
 *
 * The chain is a stand-in that answers getLogs by event and filter; nothing
 * reaches a network.
 *
 * Run from app/:  ../mcp/node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/selftest-activity-eth.mts
