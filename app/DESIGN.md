# Gloam design system

Calm, monochrome and plain, in the spirit of zama.ai: ink and paper, one green
tint for what is private, Aeonik for everything, and dark mode as first-class
as light. The short version: **use space, say less, keep one action per
screen, and never stamp "private" on everything.**

The tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`. This file says how to use them.

## Colour

| Role | Light | Dark | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ink | `#0B0C0E` | `#F4F5F6` | Text and the one primary action (`btn-ink`, `text-foreground`) |
| Paper | `#FFFFFF` | `#08090A` | Page background (`bg-background`) |
| App ground | `#F4F4F5` | `#08090A` | Behind app cards (set by `.gloam-app`) |
| Panel | `#FFFFFF` | `#111214` | Cards (`bg-panel`) |
| Surface | `#F3F4F5` / `#EAEBED` | `#17181B` / `#1E2023` | Fields, rows, inner tiles (`bg-surface`, `bg-surface-2`) |
| Soft, mute, faint | `#34373C`, `#5F636A`, `#979BA2` | `#CDD0D4`, `#9B9FA6`, `#6C7077` | Body copy, secondary copy, hints |
| Line | `#E4E6E9` / `#CFD2D6` | `#232529` / `#33363B` | Hairlines (`border-line`, `border-line-strong`) |
| Sealed green | `#2E7D53` (brand); `#2C774F` as the `--sealed` token, so 12px text passes AA on every light surface | `#8FD3AD` | Private, sealed or verified, and nothing else (`text-sealed`, `bg-sealed-soft`) |
| Warn, danger | `#8A5A12`, `#B4362A` | `#E8B86A`, `#F08A7E` | States only: a warning or an error |

- **Green is a tint, not an accent.** Use it only where something is private, sealed or verified, and keep it under 5% of a screen. Buttons, links, nav and marketing calls to action are never green.
- **No other hues.** No indigo, purple, blue or yellow accents. Warn and danger are for states, not decoration.
- The legacy `--lime` and `--navy*` slots now alias ink and greys. Don't build anything new on them.
- Every colour comes from a token, so dark mode is automatic. Don't use raw hex in components; logos and the OG cards (`lib/docsCard`) are the exception.

## Type

One family, Aeonik, self-hosted. Light (300) for display, Regular and Medium for UI.

| Class | Size | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `t-display-xl` | 42 to 76 | One per page: the landing hero, a section's big statement, /research |
| `t-display-l` | 32 to 48 | Page and post titles on the site |
| `t-display-m` | 26 to 34 | App page titles, section heads |
| `t-title` | 20 | Card titles |
| body | 15 to 18 | 17 to 18 for reading (`.article-prose`, `.docs-prose`), 14 to 15 in the app |
| `t-label` | 11 caps | Rare. Not every label is caps: a card title, a meta line or a form label is sentence case |

- Money is `tnum`, light weight when large, and never truncated mid-number (`formatUsdCompact`).
- Keep display lines to one or two lines, with `text-wrap: balance`.

## Shape

| Radius | Where |
| --- | --- |
| 999 (pill) | Buttons (`.btn`), chips (`.gl-chip`), segmented controls |
| 12 | Rows, list items, inner panels |
| 14 | Inputs (`.gl-input`, `.gl-inputwrap`) |
| 18 | Cards (`.gl-card`) |
| 20 | Big amount fields (`.gl-inputcard`), glass rims (`.gl-glass`: 8px of glass around a 12px panel, so the curves stay concentric) |
| 24 | Feature panels with the sealed field (`.gl-panel`) |

A box inside a box takes the outer radius minus the padding between them.

## Components

- **Buttons** (`.btn`, pill, 44px, `btn-sm` 36px, `btn-lg` 48px):
  - `btn-ink` is the one primary action on a screen.
  - `btn-ghost` (outlined) is a real second action.
  - `btn-quiet` is anything else. Prefer it over a second outlined button next to an ink one.
  - `btn-danger` is for destructive confirms only.
  - Buttons never move on hover; they change tone. Only `.btn:active` presses in a touch.
- **Cards** (`.gl-card`): panel, hairline, `shadow-card`, radius 18, `p-5` to `p-7`. A clickable card firms its edge on hover (`.lift`) and never lifts.
- **Fields**: `.gl-input` for text, `.gl-inputcard` for the big amount fields, `.gl-chip` for small picks (25%, Max). Dropdowns use the shared Gloam dropdown, never a native `<select>`.
- **Sealed field** (`SealedField` in a `.gl-panel`): the one luminous surface. It signals privacy in the app and carries covers on the site. Use one per screen at most.
- **Status**: one clear signal. No "Private" pill on every row and no "Public" pill on every card. Say it once in the card title or the empty state.
- **Icons**: bare strokes at 1.5 to 1.8 weight in `currentColor`, with no tile or circle behind them. Real logos come from `TokenLogo` and `public/brand/logos`, never a monogram when the real mark exists.

## Layout

- The site container is `max-w-[1400px] px-4 sm:px-7`, the same as the header. Every section aligns to it.
- Reading columns are 680 to 720px (`ArticleLayout`, docs).
- The app frame (`AppShell`) is a floating sidebar on desktop and a top bar with a sheet on phones. Content sits in `max-w-[1120px]`. The page header is the title on the left, one short line under it, and at most one action on the right.
- App navigation:
  - Portfolio
  - Vault, with its actions listed under it: Add privately, Pay privately, Receive, Swap, Cash out, then Trade and Public send where the network has them
  - Payroll
  - Markets, on stock networks
  - Prove
  - Settings and Docs at the foot

  Every action is a deep link (`lib/vaultNav`). The Portfolio quick actions use the same names.
- For row and column swaps, use real media queries (`.gl-sidebar`, `.gl-pagehead`), not `hidden lg:flex`. Webpack dev can drop the variant.
- Mind the touch targets: 40px for anything tappable on a phone, and visible focus rings everywhere.

## Writing

Plain language, short sentences, no jargon on screen:
- Say private balance, not note.
- Say Gloam address, not receive tag.
- Say claim link and cash out.
- Say mainnet and testnet, with no gloss.

No em dashes, no hype, never "happy to". Keep the product verbs: Add privately, Pay privately, Receive, Swap, Cash out, Prove.

## The anti-slop law

Read `https://pols.dev/slop.md` before any UI work. The tells this product has slipped into before:

- A filled button next to an outlined one as the default action row
- A tinted pill on every piece of metadata, and an icon sitting in a coloured circle
- The same tracked-caps label on every heading, eyebrow and footer title
- A card that lifts and blooms a shadow on hover, and a pulsing "live" dot as decoration
- Content that starts at opacity 0 and waits for a script to show it
- Tabs inside tabs
- A nav label that doesn't match its page title
