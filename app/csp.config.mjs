/**
 * The Content-Security-Policy Gloam is moving towards. It is sent as
 * Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only (next.config.ts): browsers report what it
 * would block in the console but block nothing, so wallets, WalletConnect, the
 * RPCs, the prover's WebAssembly and analytics keep working while the list is
 * checked against real use. Once the console stays clean it can be enforced.
 *
 * connect-src must cover every RPC the app or a wallet connector calls from the
 * browser: scripts/selftest-csp.mts fails if a network or bridge origin chain
 * uses a host that is missing here.
