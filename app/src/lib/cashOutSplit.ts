/**
 * "Cash out a different amount". A cash out spends one whole note, so to cash
 * out part of one the app first pays that part to the person's own fresh note
 * (a private transfer with two outputs: the amount, and the change), waits for
 * it to land, and then cashes out the amount note. The money never leaves the
 * person: both new notes are theirs, and the transfer reveals nothing.
 *
 * Both new notes are saved before anything is sent, out of the balance until
 * the chain shows them (sweepPending, the same rule as every send). A note is
 * dropped only when the transfer surely never went out (lib/walletErrors); a
 * send that may have gone out keeps them, and the next sync settles them
 * (lib/claimSweep reconcileClaims). Each names the note it came from
 * (sweptFrom), so the sync that counts them also retires that note: the money
 * is never counted twice, and if that note is spent some other way the two
 * that can never land leave the balance.
