/**
 * A chain's public RPCs, in order, as one transport that keeps working while
 * one of them is down or slow. Every read the app and the server make goes
 * through it (lib/rhClient, lib/wagmi, lib/serverRpc).
 *
 * Each request goes to the first RPC in the list that is not resting, and on
 * down the list if that one fails. One that fails as a node (a timeout, a
 * dropped connection, an HTTP error, a rate limit) rests for REST_MS: it is
 * not asked again until then, so a node that is down costs one failed request
 * per REST_MS, not one per request. When every RPC is resting they are all
 * asked again, in order, so the list never refuses a request by itself. An
 * RPC that answers with a JSON-RPC error is not resting (the answer is about
 * the request, a range it does not serve, say) and the next one is asked; if
 * none serves it, the first such answer is the error passed on. A revert is
 * final, as with viem's fallback. Each RPC is asked once per pass
 * (a hung node costs one timeout, not one per retry); `config.retryCount`
 * more passes are made only while every failure was a node failure.
 *
 * A URL in NO_LOG_RPCS (lib/networks) is never asked for eth_getLogs: those
 * public RPCs refuse or cap log reads, and a log walk that fell back to one
 * would split itself into hundreds of tiny reads.
 *
 * Sends: with `sendTo: "one"` a signed transaction goes to exactly one RPC,
 * the first that is not resting, and never on to another. A copy of a send
 * the first node may have taken could only revert or come back as a nonce
 * clash that hides it (lib/relay/server reads that failure as maybe_sent).
