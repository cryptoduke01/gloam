/**
 * TIP-403 transfer policies on Tempo (browser and server, read-only).
 *
 * Every TIP-20 stablecoin on Tempo points at a policy in the TIP-403 registry
 * precompile. On each transfer the token asks the registry whether the sender
 * and the recipient are authorized, and reverts with PolicyForbids if not.
 * Policy 0 rejects everyone, policy 1 allows everyone, and custom policies
 * (id 2 and up) are an issuer's allowlist, blocklist, or (TIP-1015) a compound
 * policy with separate sender and recipient lists.
 *
 * A Gloam deposit is a TIP-20 transfer from the user to the vault, and a cash
 * out is a transfer from the vault to a public address. Those are the only two
 * places value moves, so Gloam checks the issuer's policy at exactly those two
 * edges, before the user signs or the relay submits:
 *
 *   deposit:  the wallet may send, and the vault may receive
 *   cash out: the vault may send, and the recipient may receive
 *
 * The token enforces the same rule on-chain no matter what, so this check is an
 * early, clear stop, not the guarantee. If the RPC cannot be reached, callers
 * fail open and the chain still decides.
 *
 * Everything here is eth_call only, through an injected reader, so it can be
 * tested without a network. See tip403Server.ts for the wired-up version.
