/**
 * The RPC the server uses for a chain. Server reads and relay sends all leave
 * from Vercel's shared IPs, so under load a chain's public RPC starts answering
 * 429. Set GLOAM_RPC_URL_<chainId> (server env only, never NEXT_PUBLIC_) to a
 * private endpoint and the server uses it first, with the public RPC behind it.
 * Without it, the public RPC alone, as before.
 *
 * A private RPC is used only once it answers eth_chainId with its own chain.
 * The vault has the same address on every chain, so a node for another chain
 * (a Base Sepolia URL pasted under Base mainnet's id, say) would answer every
 * vault read with that chain's state, and the answers would look real. One
 * that answers for another chain is never used: reads go to the public RPC,
 * and a send is refused before it reaches any node (WrongChainRpcError). One
 * that has not answered yet (down, slow, timed out) is passed over for a
 * while: reads and the relay's send go to the public RPC instead, so a private
 * RPC that is down never takes the server or the relay down with it. So is
 * one that passed the check and later hangs or fails (a timeout, a 5xx, a
 * rate limit): that call fails as before (a send of it is maybe_sent, never
 * sent again elsewhere), and the next ones go to the public RPC until the
 * private one is checked again.
 *
 * The public side is the chain's whole list of public RPCs, in order
 * (lib/rpcList): one that is down is passed over for a while, and a send
 * still goes to exactly one node.
