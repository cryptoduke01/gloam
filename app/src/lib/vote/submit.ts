/**
 * Taking a signed vote: check the input, the window, the signature and the
 * weight, then keep it if it is the wallet's latest. Server only. The API
 * route passes the vote, its snapshot and the clock in, so the self-test runs
 * the same code against a test vote.
 *
 * A snapshot-weighted vote takes the weight from the snapshot. A
 * close-weighted one reads the wallet's $GLOAM now: it can vote when it holds
 * some, and the ballot keeps that balance (the final weight is set at close).
