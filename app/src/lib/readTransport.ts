/**
 * The transport every read for a Gloam network goes through, in the browser
 * (wagmi, lib/rhClient, the transparency ledger) and on the server
 * (lib/serverRpc).
 *
 * The head side is the chain's public RPCs as one list (lib/rpcList): in
 * order, one that is down passed over for a while, a send to one RPC only with
 * `sendTo: "one"`, no log reads to an RPC in NO_LOG_RPCS. Where the first RPC
 * keeps only recent history (Ethereum Sepolia's publicnode, about 10,000
 * blocks), the network names a historyRpc, and logs, receipts and state older
 * than its `recentBlocks` are read there instead, through one plain `http`:
 * the vault tree rebuilt from the deploy block, a payment proof for an old
 * transfer. The rest, above all receipt waits and the reads right after a
 * transaction, stays on the head list. Every other network reads through the
 * list alone, as before.
 *
 * The routing itself is the SDK's (splitReadTransport), so the app, the SDK
 * and the MCP split reads the same way. Both sides are this app's own viem
 * transports, never the SDK's copy, so errors keep the classes app code checks
 * (the relay's "may have been sent" test is `instanceof HttpRequestError`), and
 * the split keeps the head list's `methods`, which viem's fallback reads to
 * keep a raw send off a backup.
