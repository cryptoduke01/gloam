/**
 * Checking a proof of funds, payment, exact balance or payroll total, the way the /verify page
 * shows it: one plain-language line per check, in order. Nothing here trusts the proof's plain
 * fields on their own; each is matched against the proof's public signals, and
 * the signals against the snark, the context and the chain.
 *
 * `ok` means every check passed and the proof has not expired. A check that
 * could not finish ("unknown": the network did not answer, or a payment's
 * transaction could not be found) is never a pass.
 *
 * Cheap checks come first: the chain is only read for a proof whose math,
 * label and fields already hold, so a junk proof costs no network calls.
 *
 * What a proof of payment shows: a private send in Gloam's vault paid at least
 * this much into a note, and whoever made the proof knows that note's key. The
 * payer picks the payee note's key, so the payer can make the same proof, and a
 * send to yourself looks the same as one to someone else. It never shows that
 * a third party paid the holder.
 *
 * What an exact balance shows: one note of exactly this amount is in the vault
 * and whoever made the proof knows its key. Not that it is still unspent.
