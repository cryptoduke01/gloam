/**
 * Fund a fresh wallet from the private balance, ready to use Borro on Robinhood
 * Chain. The position stays public; it just doesn't point to the main wallet.
 *
 * No new money logic. The two payments are a private cash out's two pieces
 * (lib/cashOutPrivately): each is split off, proven and handed to the relay, in
 * order, and a run stops at the first problem with the rest safe in the private
 * balance. Gas is set up first, so the wallet's USDG is never committed without
 * it. With Now it also lands first. With a window each piece goes at its own
 * random time, so the USDG can land before the gas money does. The only new
 * thing is "Now", which sends a piece at once instead of scheduling it, the same
 * relayed cash out as Pay > Cash out. A wallet that already has gas can skip the
 * gas piece.
 *
 * Then lib/gasStation: the USDG waits at the wallet's station until the relay
 * makes it and pumps it into ETH. Every step reads from the chain, so nothing
 * has to be remembered: paste the same address later and it picks up.
