/**
 * The partner relay (POST /api/v1/relay): one proven action sent through the Gloam
 * relay's own functions (lib/relay/server), then counted to the partner whose key sent
 * it (lib/partners recordActivity).
 *
 * What is counted, and from what:
 *   transfer  a private payment, with nothing about it but that it happened; or,
 *             with { partnerFee: { kind, asset, amount } }, the partner's own
 *             interface fee on a payment of its user (lib/partnerFees): checked
 *             against the partner's setting before it is sent, never counted as a
 *             payment, and counted as a fee charged once it lands (the route does that)
 *   unshield  a cash out, with its asset and amount (public inputs of its proof)
 *   swap      a private swap, with its input's asset and amount (public inputs of
 *             its unshield proof), but only when the vault read the note as unspent
 *             just before the send: a spent note can only take the refund path,
 *             which brings money back and is not a swap
 *   memo      a payment message, not counted
 *   swapExit  a swap's money leaving by its exit key, not counted
 * A refund or an exit is claimed for the partner without being counted, so its
 * transaction can't later be attributed as a swap or a deposit.
 * Whether a swap is new is read from the vault, never taken from the request.
 * A cash out's and a swap's vault fee is recorded with it: the amount times the
 * vault's withdrawFeeBps, read after the send (cached a few minutes), the way
 * the vault works it out. A fee that can't be read is left unknown.
 *
 * Server only. The relay functions and the vault read are injectable for tests.
