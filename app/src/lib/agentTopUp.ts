/**
 * Prepaid agent top-ups: an owner refills an AI agent's wallet from their
 * private balance on a schedule, with the app closed.
 *
 * Keys and proving live in the browser, so nothing can make a proof on a
 * schedule (a payroll schedule is only a reminder, lib/payrollSchedule). What
 * can run on its own is a proof already made: the relay holds it, with no
 * secret, and sends it on its day (lib/relay/scheduled). So a series is
 * prepaid. The whole total is set aside by splitting it into one note per
 * top-up, one cash out is proven per note to the agent's wallet, and each is
 * handed to the relay for its own day, drawn at random inside that day.
 *
 * That is a private cash out (lib/cashOutPrivately) with up to 12 equal pieces
 * and a day each instead of a window, so nothing here moves money itself, and
 * a stop leaves what a stopped private cash out leaves:
 *  - top-ups already scheduled go out as planned, and each can be cancelled;
 *  - one split off but not scheduled stays in the private balance and shows
 *    (unscheduledPieces), to schedule again or keep;
 *  - the rest of the money stays in the balance as one note, and the slots
 *    never made show as a series to finish;
 *  - a split that may have gone out keeps both its notes out of the balance
 *    until the next sync settles them (lib/claimSweep).
 *
 * The money stays in the vault until each top-up goes out. Each proof stays
 * valid until its note is spent, whatever the relay does with its copy, so a
 * top-up cancelled, refused or given up on moves to a fresh note before it can
 * be spent (shield proofLoose, lib/claimSweep moveRevertedNotes). The mark that
 * says so is on disk before the proof leaves, so a closed tab changes nothing.
 * A note's tag (LocalNote.cashOutPlan.topUp) outlives its job, so a top-up that
 * ended still shows where it went.
 *
 * Not offered on Ethereum mainnet, where gas costs more than the fee brings in
 * (lib/relay/scheduled DATED_OFF_CHAINS): the relay refuses it as well.
 *
 * What it shows: each cash out's amount, the agent's wallet and the time are
 * public, and all of a series land in one wallet, so anyone can add them up.
 * Only where the money came from stays private, so a series can't start from a
 * deposit that is still fresh. A proof carries the vault root it was made
 * against, and one that goes out with the app closed keeps that root, which
 * would otherwise date the series to right after the deposit (fundingGate).
 *
 * A series can name a webhook, for the relay to say when a top-up fails or is
 * held (lib/relay/webhook). Whoever runs that address learns when, and no more.
