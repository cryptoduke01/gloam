/**
 * "Cash out privately": one cash out made into a few pieces (lib/cashOutPlan
 * picks them), each handed to the relay through "cash out later", so each goes
 * out at its own random time inside the window the person picked.
 *
 * No new money logic: each piece is split off with lib/cashOutSplit (a private
 * transfer to the person's own two new notes, both saved before it is sent),
 * proven like any cash out (lib/cashOutProof), and scheduled with
 * lib/cashOutLater. One piece at a time, in order: split it off, prove it,
 * schedule it, then the next one from the change. Everything goes through the
 * relay, so the wallet never shows.
 *
 * Every piece is tagged (LocalNote.cashOutPlan) when it is split off, before
 * anything is sent. So whatever stops a run (a refused split, a relay that is
 * down, a closed tab), nothing is lost and nothing is hidden:
 *  - pieces already scheduled go out as planned, and each can be cancelled;
 *  - a piece split off but not scheduled stays in the private balance and
 *    shows as one (unscheduledPieces), to schedule again or keep;
 *  - the rest of the money stays in the private balance as one note;
 *  - a split that may have gone out keeps both its notes, out of the balance
 *    until the next sync settles them (lib/claimSweep), like any split.
 * A run stops at the first problem. It never guesses past one.
 *
 * A proof stays valid until its note is spent, so a piece whose proof reached the
 * relay and did not go out moves to a fresh note before it can be spent, however
 * that came about (shield proofLoose): it is not one to schedule again.
 *
 * A prepaid agent top-up (lib/agentTopUp) is the same run with more pieces,
 * each sent on a day of its own instead of inside a window.
