/**
 * Recovery: get your private balance back on any device by signing in.
 *
 * This browser keeps an encrypted copy of its private balance (the notes it
 * can spend, plus its receive keys) on Gloam's server, with the payment codes
 * only it may hold: sent codes whose money has not moved (Sent links) and
 * payroll runs with a payment that may still land. The key comes from one
 * of two places:
 *  - a wallet signature over a fixed message. A browser wallet signs the same
 *    message the same way every time, so the same wallet always rebuilds the
 *    same key. Checked by signing twice when recovery is turned on.
 *  - a passkey's PRF output, which works with any wallet (Tempo Wallet too)
 *    and follows the user wherever their passkeys sync.
 * From that secret, HKDF derives the backup id (where the copy is filed), a
 * write token (to replace or delete it) and the AES-GCM key. The server only
 * ever sees the id, the token's hash and ciphertext.
 *
 * The wallet message has two versions, and each gives a different key. Version
 * 1 is plain text, which a wallet can't tie to a site. Version 2 is a Sign-In
 * with Ethereum message naming Gloam's host, so a wallet that checks can warn
 * when any other site asks for it. New recovery uses version 2. Backups under
 * version 1 keep working, and move across when they are restored or when the
 * person updates the key in Settings (see moveBackup).
