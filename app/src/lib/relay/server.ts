/**
 * Gloam relay, server side.
 *
 * Submits already-proven private sends, cash outs and payment memos from a
 * Gloam relay account, so the user's own wallet never appears next to them on
 * a block explorer. The pool never checks msg.sender on transfer/unshield (the
 * Groth16 proof is the authorization, and unshield binds the recipient inside
 * the proof), so relaying cannot redirect funds: the worst a relay can do is
 * refuse to submit.
 *
 * Guard rails:
 *   - only the active pool's transfer/unshield and the memo board's postMemo,
 *     plus, with GLOAM_RELAY_GAS_STATION=on, Borro's gas station factory's make
 *     and a wallet's own station's pump (lib/relay/gasStation): a request never
 *     names a target
 *   - one request per spend at a time: a send or cash out takes a lock on its
 *     nullifier, shared across instances (lib/relay/inflight, Redis only: when
 *     Redis is set but not answering, or a production build has none, the
 *     relay is off and sends nothing), before anything is read from the chain, so copies of one proof sent together cannot each
 *     pass the dry run and then revert at the relay's expense; the lock is
 *     dropped if nothing went out or the receipt shows the transaction
 *     reverted, and otherwise kept until it expires once a transaction did
 *   - spent and root check on every send and cash out, before the dry run, so
 *     a spent note never reaches the gas estimate
 *   - dry run (gas estimate against the pool) before anything is sent, so a bad
 *     proof, a spent note or a stale root costs the relay nothing
 *   - no cash out to the vault itself, the memo board, a token contract, a
 *     swap router or the zero address (lib/cashOutTarget), which would strand
 *     the money
 *   - memos only for commitments the pool has actually inserted, and no larger
 *     than a real sealed ticket needs (RELAY_MEMO_MAX_BYTES)
 *   - sanctions screening of every public recipient (a cash out's `to`) before
 *     anything is checked or sent (lib/screeningServer.ts), plus on Tempo the
 *     asset's TIP-403 issuer policy for the vault and `to`; private sends and
 *     memos carry no public address, so there is nothing to screen
 *   - a gas ceiling per chain (lib/relay/gasCeiling: 3 gwei on Ethereum by
 *     default, none on the L2s): above it nothing is sent and the request is
 *     refused as gas_high, and a send under it never offers more than 1.5
 *     times the ceiling per unit of gas
 *   - a floor under a private swap where gas is dear (lib/relay/swapFloor): its
 *     vault fee must cover its gas, or it is refused as swap_small before anything
 *     is sent, and a few reverted swaps or refunds in an hour pause them there
 *   - per-sender and per-network rate limits, shared across instances (the
 *     network cap counts only transactions actually sent), and a few relayed
 *     payment messages per payment: the payer's own (with the memo ticket the
 *     transfer handed back), each partner key's, and one small allowance that
 *     everyone else shares, none of them kept by IP
 *
 * Submission is free for the user on every network, mainnet included: the relay
 * pays the gas. A relay fee would need its own public output inside the circuit,
 * which the mainnet pools do not have, so at launch the Gloam team pays mainnet
 * gas from the relay account. The only fee on mainnet is the pool's 0.25% on a cash out.
 *
 * Key: GLOAM_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY (server env only, never NEXT_PUBLIC_). With no
 * key set the relay reports itself disabled and the app falls back to wallet
 * submission. GLOAM_RELAY_MEMO_SECRET (server only, 32 characters or more)
 * signs the memo tickets; unset, no tickets go out and every payment message
 * but a partner key's shares the small allowance.
