/**
 * Gloam relay, server side.
 *
 * Submits already-proven private sends, cash outs and payment memos from a
 * Gloam relay account, so the user's own wallet never appears next to them on
 * a block explorer. The pool never checks msg.sender on transfer/unshield (the
 * Groth16 proof is the authorization, and unshield binds the recipient inside
 * the proof), so relaying cannot redirect funds: the worst a relay can do is
 * refuse to submit.
 *
 * Guard rails:
 *   - only the active pool's transfer/unshield and the memo board's postMemo
 *   - one request per spend at a time: a send or cash out takes a lock on its
 *     nullifier, shared across instances (lib/relay/inflight), before anything
 *     is read from the chain, so copies of one proof sent together cannot each
 *     pass the dry run and then revert at the relay's expense; the lock is
 *     dropped if nothing went out, and kept until it expires once a
 *     transaction did
 *   - spent and root check on every send and cash out, before the dry run, so
 *     a spent note never reaches the gas estimate
 *   - dry run (gas estimate against the pool) before anything is sent, so a bad
 *     proof, a spent note or a stale root costs the relay nothing
 *   - no cash out to the vault itself or the memo board (lib/cashOutTarget),
 *     which would strand the money
 *   - memos only for commitments the pool has actually inserted, and no larger
 *     than a real sealed ticket needs (RELAY_MEMO_MAX_BYTES)
 *   - sanctions screening of every public recipient (a cash out's `to`) before
 *     anything is checked or sent (lib/screeningServer.ts), plus on Tempo the
 *     asset's TIP-403 issuer policy for the vault and `to`; private sends and
 *     memos carry no public address, so there is nothing to screen
 *   - per-sender and per-network rate limits, shared across instances (the
 *     network cap counts only transactions actually sent), and a few relayed
 *     payment messages per payment
 *
 * Testnet: submission is free. Mainnet needs a relay fee carved out inside the
 * circuit (an extra public output), otherwise the relay pays everyone's gas.
 *
 * Key: GLOAM_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY (server env only, never NEXT_PUBLIC_). With no
 * key set the relay reports itself disabled and the app falls back to wallet
 * submission.
