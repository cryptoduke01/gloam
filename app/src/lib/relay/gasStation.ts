/**
 * What the relay will do for a gas station, and when. The rules only: sending
 * lives in lib/relay/server (relayGasStation), through the same lanes as every
 * other relay transaction.
 *
 * Off unless GLOAM_RELAY_GAS_STATION=on. When on, the relay pays for two calls
 * and nothing else: make(wallet) on Borro's factory, and pump(minOut, maxIn) on
 * that wallet's own station. A request names a wallet and a step. The target,
 * the calldata and the value are never taken from it: the station comes from
 * predictStation, so nobody can point the relay at another contract.
 *
 * What one person can cost the relay:
 *  - the station must already hold STATION_MIN_USDG, checked here because pump
 *    on an empty station succeeds and a dry run can't tell
 *  - a wallet with code is refused, and any send estimated over
 *    STATION_MAX_ESTIMATE: pump hands the wallet all its gas, so a contract would
 *    run on ours. That cap also catches one that gains its code after the read
 *  - one request per wallet and step at a time (a lock in lib/relay/server), so
 *    copies sent together can't each pass the checks and burn gas on a no-op
 *  - STATION_WALLET_DAILY sends per wallet, STATION_IP_HOURLY per sender, and
 *    gasStationDailySends for everyone together
 *  - no send above STATION_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI, about five times the usual price
 *
 * make and pump take about 280,000 gas together, around $0.013 at 0.02 gwei and
 * $2,250 ETH (Robinhood Chain charges no L1 data fee on top today). The default
 * daily budget is under $1, and about $2 with every send at the gas limit.
 *
 * That budget caps the loss, not the abuse. The USDG a station needs comes back
 * to whoever sent it as ETH, less the swap's fee, so filling the day's budget
 * costs a stranger far less than the 0.25 USDG per wallet looks like: well under
 * $1. Doing so pauses only this feature until the next day.
 *
 * The counts are kept apart on purpose: the wallet's count has no IP in its key,
 * and the sender's has no wallet, so nothing here ties the two together.
