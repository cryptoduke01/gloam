/**
 * Scheduled cash outs: "cash out later".
 *
 * A cash out is public (the asset, the amount and the wallet it pays), so one
 * that follows a payment within a minute can be matched to it by timing. Here
 * the browser makes the cash-out proof as usual and hands it to the relay with
 * a send time picked at random inside the window the person chose (an hour,
 * six, or a day). A cron sends due jobs through the normal relay path
 * (lib/relay/server).
 *
 * A job holds no secret: the proof and its public inputs. The proof binds the
 * amount and the recipient, so whoever holds the job can only send it as it is
 * or not at all. Before sending, the chain is read at one block: a spent
 * nullifier means the money already moved. The vault accepts every root it
 * ever had (knownRoots, not only its recent history), so a proof does not go
 * stale while it waits; a root it does not know at all means the proof can
 * never land, so the job expires and nothing moved.
 *
 * Sending is idempotent. A job is taken under a short lock, marked "sending"
 * before the relay is called, and the chain is read first on every pass, so a
 * job that was sent but not recorded (a crash, a lost reply) settles as sent
 * instead of going out twice. The relay itself refuses a second copy of a
 * spend while one is in flight (lib/relay/inflight).
 *
 * A proof also carries the vault root it was made against, and the vault keeps
 * every root, so anyone who rebuilds the tree can tell roughly when a waiting
 * proof was made. While the app is open it makes a fresh proof of the same
 * cash out and swaps it in (replaceJobProof): same job, same spend, recipient,
 * amount, asset and send time, only a later root. One that goes out while the
 * app is closed keeps the root of its last proof.
 *
 * Once the relay may have handed a job to the node (a timeout, a lost reply,
 * any answer that is not a clear refusal), the job stays "sending" until the
 * chain settles it: it is never cancelled, failed or said to be unsent on a
 * guess. Only the chain (spent, or a root it does not know with the note
 * unspent, read at one block) or a refusal raised before anything reached
 * the node ends it.
 *
 * Gas: the relay pays it, so above the relay's gas ceiling on a chain
 * (lib/relay/gasCeiling: 3 gwei on Ethereum by default) a due job is not sent.
 * It waits, still scheduled and still cancellable, and is looked at again
 * every few minutes until gas comes back under the ceiling, for up to
 * GAS_WAIT_MAX_MS past its send time. Waiting for gas never counts as a failed
 * try and never uses up the give-up time: once gas comes down, the 2 hours a
 * passing problem gets start from the end of the wait.
 *
 * A job can also be dated: set for a day up to MAX_DATED_DAYS ahead instead of
 * a window (a prepaid agent top-up, lib/agentTopUp). Its send time is drawn at
 * random inside that UTC day, so a weekly top-up never lands like clockwork.
 * Everything above holds for it, and its record lasts as long as it has to
 * wait (liveTtlSec). Nobody is at the screen when one comes due, so a passing
 * problem gets a day (DATED_GIVE_UP_AFTER_MS), not 2 hours, and is tried every
 * few minutes (DATED_RETRY_MS) so it never crowds out what is due now.
 * Dated jobs are refused where they lose money (DATED_OFF_CHAINS), and until the
 * relay can seal them at rest (lib/relay/jobSeal).
 *
 * A dated job can carry a webhook. A run hands back what to tell it
 * (takeNotices) and the route delivers that once every job is settled
 * (lib/relay/webhook): a notice can't change what happens to a job.
 *
 * This file is the logic and an in-memory store (for tests and local runs);
 * lib/relay/scheduledStore.ts keeps jobs in Redis in production.
