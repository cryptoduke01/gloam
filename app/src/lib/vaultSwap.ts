/**
 * Swapping inside the private balance, through the vault (contracts/src/
 * GloamVaultSwap*.sol). One relayed transaction takes one note out of the
 * vault, buys an exact amount of another asset on a DEX, and puts that amount
 * back into the vault as a new note. Who swapped stays private; the amounts
 * are public, like any DEX trade.
 *
 * The note's unshield proof names a per-swap escrow as `to` (escrowFor on the
 * router), derived from the new note, a refund note and the route, so nobody
 * who copies the proof can change any of them. The refund note only lands if
 * someone sends the unshield on its own; then the money comes back as it.
 *
 * Robinhood Chain has two routers. v1 (GloamVaultSwapV4) swaps USDG and GLOAM
 * over three pools fixed at deploy. v2 (GloamVaultSwapV4b) swaps any token in
 * RH_SWAP_ASSETS_V2 for any other over RH_SWAP_POOLS_V2, in up to three hops,
 * with ETH held in the vault as WETH. One switch, VAULT_SWAP_V2_ROUTER, picks
 * which one new swaps use; the relay keeps both, so a refund of a swap made
 * through either still finishes.
 *
 * v3 (GloamVaultSwapV4c, and GloamVaultSwapTempo2 on Tempo) adds native ETH notes,
 * Base and Ethereum, and an exit for money a refund can't bring back. It is off
 * until a router address is filled into VAULT_SWAP_V3_LIVE, chain by chain
 * (DEPLOY-ROUTER.md). Its escrow key has two more fields, so a swap is built for the
 * router it goes through.
 *
 * Shared by the app and the relay server: no browser-only imports here.
