/**
 * Secret detection for the hosted MCP server (www.gloam.trade/mcp).
 *
 * The hosted server only reads and plans. It never needs a private key, a
 * recovery phrase or a Gloam note secret, so any tool call whose arguments
 * look like one is refused before the tool runs, with a warning. The match is
 * never echoed back or logged.
 *
 * What counts as a secret:
 *  - 64 hex characters (an EVM private key; a transaction hash looks the same,
 *    so both are refused)
 *  - 12 or more BIP-39 words in a row (a recovery phrase)
 *  - an extended private key (xprv, tprv, yprv, zprv)
 *  - Gloam notes and tickets: gloam1. / gloam1e. (note package), gloam2t.
 *    (sealed payment ticket), gloambak1. (backup), gloamenc1: (encrypted note
 *    vault), gloamnote1: (x402 note), gloamx402pay1: (x402 payment payload)
 *  - a claim link (#claim=...)
 *  - a JWK with its private part ("d")
 *
 * A receive tag (gloamr1.) is public and is not matched.
