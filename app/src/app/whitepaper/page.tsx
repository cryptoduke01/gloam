        This document is a living public draft. It describes design targets,
        shipped testnet capability, and intentional non-claims. It is not an

      <h2 id="abstract">1. Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Public blockchains made settlement programmable and verifiable. They also
        made financial activity permanently legible. Wallet graphs, size, and
        timing form a continuous record of intent, legible to bots, competitors,
        counterparties, and anyone with an explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stablecoins are becoming how businesses and AI agents pay each other,
        and every one of those payments is public. Gloam makes them private,
        and lets the payer prove exactly what someone needs to see. It is a
        self-custodial vault on Tempo and Robinhood Chain in which stablecoins,
        and on Robinhood Chain stock tokens, can be held, paid and proven with
        reduced public visibility. The thesis is one line:{" "}
        <strong>private by default, provable on demand.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gloam is not new cryptography. A payment has one owner, so the owner
        proves it on their own device with zero-knowledge proofs from the Zcash
        lineage, and nobody else ever holds a key. What is new is the building
        block on top: private payments you can prove (section 7).
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy on a transparent chain is not the absence of transactions from
        explorers. It is the separation of <em>settlement visibility</em> from{" "}
        <em>strategy visibility</em>. Shield and unshield remain deliberate public
        edges. While assets remain inside the shielded set, amounts and internal
        transfer relationships are designed not to appear as a simple public
        balance sheet for a single address.
      </p>

      <h2 id="problem">2. Problem</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Transparent finance as confession</h3>
      <p>
        Open ledgers encode intent. A salary paid onchain is readable by every
        coworker. A supplier payment shows your margins. A treasury balance
        shows your runway. A large swap signals urgency. Address clustering
        tools turn a wallet into a public narrative. For teams, funds and
        agents this is not a feature. It is a cost priced into every
        interaction.
      </p>
      <h3>2.2 Stablecoin payments are public by default</h3>
      <p>
        Real stablecoin payments came to about $390B in 2025, double 2024, and
        58% of that ($226B) was business to business. Every one of those
        payments, and the balance behind it, can be read by anyone with an
        explorer. AI agents that pay for tools over HTTP add a new payer with
        the same exposure: an agent&apos;s wallet shows what it buys and how
        it works.
      </p>
      <h3>2.3 Tokenized equities inherit the same exposure</h3>
      <p>
        Robinhood Chain positions itself as infrastructure for financial
        services and real-world assets, and tokenized stocks already trade
        there. Without application-layer privacy, a stock position is as
        public as a payment.
      </p>
      <h3>2.4 Why now</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          New payment chains launched in 2026: Tempo mainnet on 18 March,
          Robinhood Chain on 1 July and Arc on 16 September. All are public by
          default.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stablecoins held privately in Railgun on Ethereum grew from $2.1M in
          January 2024 to $51M in October 2026. That is still under 0.1% of a
          $311B supply.
        </li>
        <li>
          FinCEN withdrew its proposed mixer rule on 5 October 2026. The GENIUS
          Act requires stablecoin issuers to be able to freeze, and
          Gloam&apos;s design never stops them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="thesis">3. Thesis and principles</h2>
      <p>
        Gloam asserts that private holding, private payment and selective proof
        are first-class requirements for onchain money, not optional skins on a
        public wallet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>One owner, no key holder.</strong> A payment has one owner,
          so the owner proves it on their own device. No committee, operator or
          server holds a key or sees the secret inputs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Honesty over theater.</strong> No mock private success. Claims
          expand only as contracts, circuits, and audits support them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle-tested patterns.</strong> Commitments, nullifiers,
          Merkle membership, and zero-knowledge proofs, not novel cryptography
          invented for a launch tweet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Edges are real.</strong> Entering and leaving the vault is
          visible. Privacy tools reduce public visibility; they do not erase the
          physical world, legal process, or operator error.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testnet until ready.</strong> Production capital requires
          production ceremonies, reviews, and operational maturity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="privacy-myth">4. What “privacy” means here</h2>
      <p>
        A common misconception is that private transactions leave no footprint
        on a block explorer. That is not how application-layer privacy on a
        public chain works.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Visible by design:</strong> that the vault contract was used;
          shield (deposit) and unshield (withdrawal) events; proof verification
          transactions and the account that submits them (the Gloam relay can
          submit in the user&apos;s place).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hidden by design (goal):</strong> amounts while shielded;
          the internal transfer graph between notes; trade intent during private
          execution (roadmap).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Degraded when the set is small:</strong> timing and size
          correlation; thin anonymity sets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Private send does not mean “nothing on the explorer.” It means the
        public record does not present a simple Alice→Bob amount story for value
        that stays inside the vault.
      </p>

      <h2 id="architecture">5. System architecture</h2>
      <h3>5.1 Placement</h3>
      <p>
        Gloam is an application-layer privacy system on a transparent L2
        (Robinhood Chain), with the same contracts deployed on Tempo, a
        payments-first L1. Settlement finality remains with the chain. Privacy
        is constructed above it via a self-custodial shielded pool, a Merkle
        tree of note commitments, nullifiers to prevent double-spends, and
        on-chain verifiers for zero-knowledge proofs. The pool holds deposits,
        but only a valid proof from the note holder moves them: there is no
        admin withdraw, and rule changes are timelocked (5.5).
      </p>
      <h3>5.2 Core components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Client application</strong>, wallet connection, note
          material generation, Merkle path reconstruction from on-chain events,
          browser-side proof generation, notes encrypted at rest, and product
          UX.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ShieldPool (Poseidon)</strong>, holds deposited assets,
          maintains the tree, accepts proof-bound shield deposits, and
          processes transfer and unshield with proof verification. It has no
          admin withdraw.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hash and tree</strong>, Poseidon-based commitments and a
          depth-20 Merkle structure aligned with circuit constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Circuits</strong>, shield (binds a deposit to its note),
          transfer (private send / split) and unshield (exit), with
          public-input layouts bound to the vault. A sealed-swap circuit for
          private trade is built but switched off. Three more circuits back the
          proofs in 6.1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verifiers</strong>, Groth16 verifiers for each on-chain
          circuit. A dual verifier routes transfer and unshield by public-input
          count; deposits use a separate shield verifier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memo board</strong>, an encrypted payment-message contract
          that lets a recipient find payments sent to them. It holds no funds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      />

      <h3>5.3 Note scheme</h3>
      <p>
        A shielded note binds a secret, amount, and asset into a commitment.
        Nullifiers are derived so that spending a note can be recorded without
        reusing it. Exact field hashes and layouts are implemented in circuit
        source and client libraries and must stay aligned across releases.
      </p>
      <h3>5.4 Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Shield</strong>, public assets enter the vault with a proof
          that the new commitment encodes exactly the amount and asset
          deposited; the commitment is inserted into the tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transfer (private send)</strong>, spend one note, insert two
          new commitments (payment and change), conserve value for a single
          asset. The payment note is encrypted to the recipient&apos;s Gloam
          address (receive tag) and posted to the memo board, where the
          recipient&apos;s app finds it by scanning. A payment link covers
          people without a Gloam address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unshield</strong>, prove ownership of a note and withdraw to
          a public address bound in the proof. Exit is a visible edge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prove</strong>, show a named party a balance, a payment
          received, or a payroll total without opening the wallet (6.1).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5.5 Custody and rule changes</h3>
      <p>
        The pool is self-custodial. No function lets the owner, the team, or
        anyone else withdraw note-backed funds; value leaves only through an
        unshield proof, to the recipient bound in that proof. The owner&apos;s
        one transfer function returns native currency sent to the contract by
        mistake, above what notes back, and cannot reach note-backed funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner wallet can still change rules: swap verifiers, set rates, and
        set oracle feeds. Setup has ended on both live pools, so every such
        change must be queued on-chain and can only run after a public 3-day
        delay. Users see a pending change before it takes effect and can cash
        out first. On testnet the owner is a single wallet; moving it to a
        multisig is an open mainnet decision.

      />

      <h2 id="cryptography">6. Cryptography and verification</h2>
      <p>
        Circuits are written in Circom 2.1.6, with Poseidon for
        circuit-friendly hashing and Merkle membership. Proofs are Groth16 on
        BN254, generated in the browser with snarkjs 0.7.5 and checked by
        on-chain verifiers. The trusted setup used on testnet is a
        single-contributor dev ceremony: its keys must not be treated as a
        production setup, and a multi-party ceremony is required before
        mainnet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public-input layouts are versioned. Shield binds commitment, amount,
        and asset. Unshield binds root, nullifier, asset, amount, and
        recipient. Transfer binds root, nullifier, and two new commitments.
        The dual verifier routes transfer and unshield by public-input count.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sealed swap (private trade) binds root, nullifier, two new commitments,
        assets, a public min-out floor, and rate numerators. Its circuit,
        verifier, and oracle-bound rate checks are built and tested, but it is
        switched off: neither live pool has a sealed-swap verifier set, so
        every swap call reverts. Its first design could leave the pool owing
        an asset it does not hold (audit H1). It stays off while we build a new
        engine for private trading, and any re-enable goes through the 3-day
        timelock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier pools on both chains, including a keccak-based Robinhood Chain
        pool, remain on-chain for history only and are superseded. The product
        path is the Poseidon vault redeployed on 2026-09-29 with shield,
        transfer, and unshield verifiers enabled (dev keys).
      </p>
      <h3>6.1 Proofs shared with others</h3>
      <p>
        Three more circuits back proofs a holder hands to someone else: proof
        of funds (at least an amount across up to four unspent notes, balance
        hidden), proof of payment (a payment received, with the amount shown
        or only a minimum), and a payroll total (a run paid exactly a total in
        a given number of payments). These are verified off-chain, in the
        browser at gloam.trade/verify, against the live vault state. Each one
        (<code>gloamfunds1</code>, <code>gloampay1</code>,{" "}
        <code>gloamroll1</code>) carries a label naming who it is for and an
        expiry, both bound into the proof. The older{" "}
        <code>gloamdisc1</code> balance disclosure reuses the shield circuit
        and carries no recipient label or expiry.
      </p>

      <h2 id="whats-new">7. What is new in Gloam</h2>
      <p>
        Gloam is not new cryptography. It is a new building block for finance:
        private payments you can prove. This section draws the line exactly.
      </p>
      <h3>7.1 Not new</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The private pool design: notes, nullifiers and a Merkle tree, from
          the Zcash lineage starting in 2016, and used by Tornado, Railgun and
          Cloak.
        </li>
        <li>
          Selective disclosure as an idea: Zcash and Railgun viewing keys,
          Privacy Pools, and Zama decryption rights.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>7.2 New, as far as our research found</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Payroll total proof.</strong> The <code>payroll_total</code>{" "}
          circuit proves that a run of up to 32 payments adds up to exactly a
          total, all funded by the prover, without
          showing who got what. Its public inputs are{" "}
          <code>[asset, total, count, paymentsHash, context]</code>. Each slot
          opens both the payment note and the note it spent, so a payment the
          prover only received cannot be counted as one they made. We found
          nothing like it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proofs scoped to one reader.</strong> Who the proof is for (a
          label), its expiry, the chain and the pool are hashed into one public{" "}
          <code>context</code> input:{" "}
          <code>keccak256(abi.encode(&quot;gloam.proof.v1&quot;, kind, chainId, pool, expiresAt, label)) mod p</code>.
          The <code>solvency</code>, <code>receipt</code> and{" "}
          <code>payroll_total</code> circuits bind it into the proof, so
          changing the label breaks it. Anyone can check a proof in a browser
          with no wallet at <Link href="/verify">/verify</Link>. Viewing keys,
          by contrast, show a holder&apos;s whole history and cannot be taken
          back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Private payments for AI agents.</strong> A private payment
          method proposed for the Machine Payments Protocol from Tempo and
          Stripe (tempoxyz/mpp-specs#376; MPP had no private method), private
          x402 payments, and an MCP server that gives agents handles instead of
          secrets, with spending limits.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        One honest limit: a reader can still forward a proof. It will say who
        it was made for and when it expires, but nothing stops the forwarding.
        A designated-verifier mode is next.
      </p>

      <h2 id="compare">8. How Gloam compares</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy splits into two jobs. Shared secrets, such as sealed auctions,
        order books and lending pools, need someone to compute on many
        people&apos;s hidden data, so FHE and MPC networks (Zama, Arcium) use a
        committee that holds keys. A payment has one owner, so the owner proves
        it on their own device and nobody else ever holds a key.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference shows up in a breach. If a committee or an operator is
        breached, everyone who used it can be exposed, including past
        payments. If one owner&apos;s device is breached, one person is
        exposed. Gloam builds the payments product on proven zero-knowledge
        maths, the way Stripe built on card networks.

      <h2 id="threat">9. Threat model</h2>
      <h3>9.1 In scope (design goals)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Observer reading a single address balance while assets are shielded</li>
        <li>
          Simple public reconstruction of internal note-to-note payment graphs
          (as anonymity set grows)
        </li>
        <li>Double-spend of the same note (nullifiers)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>9.2 Edges and residual leakage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shield and unshield amounts and timing on the public chain</li>
        <li>RPC and network metadata if clients are careless</li>
        <li>
          The submitting wallet, when a user sends without the relay. On
          Robinhood Chain the deployed memo board also records who posted each
          memo, so the sender stays off that record only when the relay posts
          it; Tempo&apos;s board does not record the poster.
        </li>
        <li>
          Correlation attacks when few users participate or amounts are unique
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>9.3 Out of scope as “solved by crypto alone”</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Device malware, phishing, and coerced key disclosure</li>
        <li>Legal process and off-chain identity linkage</li>
        <li>User deletion of local note material without backup</li>
        <li>Absolute anonymity against nation-state adversaries</li>
      </ul>

        The testnet application at{" "}

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Wallet connection restricted to Robinhood Chain testnet and Tempo
          Moderato testnet

        <li>Portfolio with wallet balances, shielded balances, and faucet stocks</li>
        <li>
          Stock tokens on Robinhood Chain held and sent privately, like any
          other asset in the vault
        </li>
        <li>Public send and stock token transfer paths</li>
        <li>Shield deposits into the privacy vault</li>
        <li>
          Private send (transfer) and cash-out (unshield) with browser proofs,
          optionally submitted by the Gloam relay so the user&apos;s wallet does
          not appear
        </li>
        <li>
          Receiving by Gloam address (encrypted memos) or payment link, plus
          note import
        </li>
        <li>Private payroll, scheduled payroll, and payment requests</li>
        <li>Proofs of funds, payment, and payroll totals, checked at /verify</li>
        <li>
          Private trade (sealedSwap): built, switched off while we build a new
          engine for private trading. A via-market path (cash out, public swap, re-shield) is available where
          a public pool exists, with the swap size public on that edge

      <h2 id="roadmap">11. Roadmap</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Live (testnet):</strong> public path, proof-bound shield,
          unshield, private send with encrypted memos, the Gloam relay,
          payroll, proofs of funds, payment, and payroll totals, private agent
          payments, stock tokens held and sent privately, the Tempo
          deployment, and pools with no admin withdraw and timelocked rule
          changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Underway:</strong> a new engine for private trading. The
          first sealed-swap path (circuit, verifier, oracle-bound rates) is
          built and tested but switched off. Trading mixes many people&apos;s
          orders, so it needs its own design rather than the payment one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Near term:</strong> closing the window in which a payer can
          reclaim a direct payment; a designated-verifier mode for proofs;
          encrypting the receive key at rest; anonymity set growth;
          operational monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mid term:</strong> issuer-scoped disclosure for regulated
          stablecoins on Tempo; private trading of stock tokens on the new
          engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Production gate:</strong> external review (audits so far are
          internal), a multi-party trusted setup, incident process, mainnet
          only after explicit readiness criteria.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="risks">12. Risks and limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Smart contract and circuit bugs: audits so far are internal, with no
          external audit yet
        </li>
        <li>Development proving keys from a single-contributor dev ceremony</li>
        <li>
          Rule changes, including verifier swaps, by a single owner wallet,
          limited by a public 3-day delay
        </li>
        <li>Browser-local note storage and user operational error</li>
        <li>
          A payer can reclaim a direct payment until the payee moves it,
          because the payer created the note and knows its key; a fix is in
          progress
        </li>
        <li>
          A stablecoin issuer can freeze the vault contract; the answer is to
          screen deposits so flagged funds never enter
        </li>
        <li>A reader can forward a proof meant for them</li>
        <li>Regulatory and compliance uncertainty around privacy tools</li>
        <li>Thin anonymity sets in early usage</li>
        <li>L2 and bridge operational risk of the underlying chain</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="non-claims">13. Explicit non-claims</h2>
      <p>
        Gloam does not claim mainnet readiness, an external audit, insurance of
        funds, legal immunity, or invisibility from investigation. Testnet
        assets have no
        real-world value. Nothing in this paper is investment advice.
      </p>

      <h2 id="closing">14. Closing</h2>
      <p>
        Settlement will remain public. Salaries, suppliers and strategies need
        not. Gloam builds the sealed chamber beside the open book on Tempo and
        Robinhood Chain, so people, teams and agents can hold, pay and prove
        exactly what is needed, without printing every private calculation to
        the street.
