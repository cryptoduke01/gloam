      <h2>Why agents need this most</h2>
      <p>
        An agent trading a public chain leaks its whole strategy: every position,
        size, and time is on the graph for anyone to copy or front-run. Agents run
        predictable, high-frequency strategies, so they are the easiest to
        reverse-engineer. Gloam gives an agent a private execution surface: hold,
        move, and prove value with size hidden, so its edge stays its own.
      </p>

      <h2>Two ways in</h2>
      <p>
        Both speak the same intent shape, so a plan an app builds and a plan an
        agent builds are the same object.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Directly via <code>@gloamtrade/sdk</code>.</strong> Your agent
          framework builds an intent and signs it with its own wallet. Best when
          the agent already has an execution loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Via the <code>@gloamtrade/mcp</code> server.</strong> An
          MCP-speaking model (Claude, etc.) gets Gloam as tools alongside its
          other capabilities, the same way Robinhood&apos;s own MCP exposes
          public trading. Best for a general assistant that should also act
          privately.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="virtuals">For Virtuals agents</h2>
      <p>
        Agents built on GAME get Gloam as one worker:{" "}
        <code>@gloamtrade/game-plugin-gloam</code> gives a Virtuals agent a
        private balance, private payments, cash outs and proofs of funds, under
        per-asset limits its owner sets. A companion provider pays out privately
        on ACP, so the job stays on ACP&apos;s contracts while who got paid, and
        how much, stays private.
      </p>
      <p>
        <Link href="/docs/virtuals">Gloam for Virtuals agents</Link> covers
        setup, every function, the limits, exactly what stays public, and the
        networks.
      </p>

      <h2 id="connect-by-url">Connect by URL</h2>
      <p>
        The quickest way to try Gloam from a chat. Gloam runs a hosted MCP
        server, so you add it to your client by URL and install nothing.

        It never signs, never holds funds, and never needs a private key, a
        recovery phrase or a note secret. A tool call that looks like it carries
        one is refused with a warning not to share it, and nothing is kept. When
        something has to be signed, it sends you to the app, or to the local{" "}

        machine.
      </p>

      <h2 id="fund-link">Fund an agent with one link</h2>
      <p>
        A platform can send its users to one link that opens Gloam with the
        agent&apos;s address, the amount, the token and the network filled in.
        Nothing is sent on its own: the user checks it and confirms.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`https://gloam.trade/app/vault?tab=move&mode=pay#to=<address>&amount=<amount>&asset=<token>&chain=<network>&name=<name>&note=<note>`}</code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>to</code>: a 0x address, an ENS name, or a Gloam address
          (<code>gloamr1.…</code>). A 0x address with mixed case must have a
          valid checksum; the zero address is refused.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>amount</code>: optional, in whole tokens (<code>25</code>,{" "}
          <code>12.5</code>). It is only filled in when <code>asset</code> names
          a token Gloam knows on that network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>asset</code>: the token&apos;s symbol or address on that network,
          for example <code>USDG</code> on Robinhood Chain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>chain</code>: <code>robinhood-mainnet</code>,{" "}
          <code>tempo-mainnet</code>, <code>base-mainnet</code> or{" "}
          <code>ethereum-mainnet</code> for mainnet. <code>robinhood</code>,{" "}
          <code>tempo</code>, <code>base</code> and <code>ethereum</code> are
          the testnets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>name</code> (up to 40 characters) and <code>note</code> (up to
          80): optional. The note is sealed inside a payment to a Gloam address;
          for a 0x address or ENS name it is only shown to the payer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Keep the fields after the <code>#</code>: browsers never send that part
        to a server. A Gloam address opens Pay and makes a private payment,
        free, with the amount hidden. A 0x address or an ENS name opens Cash out
        to that wallet: the relay sends it from the user&apos;s private balance
        for 0.25%, so their wallet does not show, while the receiving wallet,
        the token and the amount are public. An ENS name is looked up on
        Ethereum mainnet and paid on the network the link names. A field that
        does not check out is left blank, with the reason shown to the user.
      </p>

      <h2>Reference agent (the SDK path)</h2>
      <p>
        <code>examples/agent-shield</code> is the smallest complete agent: it
        mints a note, generates the shield proof, and deposits privately via{" "}
        <code>shieldBound</code>. The whole private path is a few lines.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`import { buildShieldBoundIntent, artifactProver } from "@gloamtrade/sdk";
import { parseEther } from "viem";

// 1) SDK mints the note + generates the shield proof
const intent = await buildShieldBoundIntent({
  amountWei: parseEther("0.001"),
  prover: artifactProver({ wasm: "shield.wasm", zkey: "shield_final.zkey" }),
});

// 2) the agent signs the resolved call with its (server-held) wallet
const hash = await wallet.writeContract({
  address: intent.exec.poolAddress,
  abi: shieldPoolAbi,
  functionName: intent.exec.fn,   // "shieldBound"
  args: intent.exec.args,
  value: intent.exec.valueWei,
});
// persist intent.note.secret in the agent's note store, keyed by commitment`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        That snippet runs on the testnet, the SDK default. For mainnet,
        pass a mainnet network (<code>mainnetNetwork(&quot;tempo&quot;)</code>,{" "}
        <code>&quot;robinhood&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;base&quot;</code> or{" "}
        <code>&quot;ethereum&quot;</code>), its stablecoin as <code>asset</code>,
        and prove with <code>circuitArtifactUrls(&quot;shield&quot;, net.chainId)</code>{" "}
        so the final keys are used. See the <Link href="/docs/quickstart">quickstart</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there the agent can cash out, pay a receive tag, or prove a balance
        to a counterparty with a <Link href="/docs/sdk/disclosure">disclosure</Link>,
        all with the same core.
      </p>

      <h2>The MCP server</h2>
      <p>
        Run it on your own machine with <code>npx -y @gloamtrade/mcp</code>. It
        signs there, under the spending limits below, and keeps keys and note
        secrets off the model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>@gloamtrade/mcp</code> exposes Gloam as tools to any MCP client. It keeps
        two phases separate on purpose: planning tools build an unsigned intent
        and describe, in plain language, what is private and what is not;
        execution tools take a plan, sign it server-side, and broadcast.

      <h2>Private agent payments (x402)</h2>
      <p>
        Agents pay for tools and data over HTTP 402. The pattern that won
        Colosseum paired x402 with stablecoins, but that settlement is fully
        public: the amount, the payer, and the payee all leak. Gloam&apos;s{" "}
        <code>gloam-private</code> scheme keeps it private and self-custodial. The
        agent settles a shielded transfer to the payee itself, so no operator or
        facilitator ever holds its key or funds, then presents the payment note,
        sealed to the payee&apos;s receive tag, plus the settlement transaction on
        the 402 retry. The payee opens the note and moves it into a fresh note
        only it knows before serving, so the payer cannot spend it back. The
        public sees only shielded transfers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This is not a Tempo Zone.</strong> A Zone is operator-visible:
        the zone operator sees every transaction inside it. Gloam is private from
        the public and from any operator; only the payer and the payee learn the
        amount. Compliance visibility is opt-in per payment through an
        issuer-scoped disclosure, not a blanket view handed to an operator. See
        the <Link href="/docs/privacy-model">privacy model</Link> for what stays
        hidden and what does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        An economy that posts a merkle root of its records every night can keep
        agent payments private and still checkable: each payment&apos;s receipt
        becomes one leaf in that root. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/agents/commitments">private commerce with commitments</Link>.

      <h2 id="check-before-paying">Check before paying (Agent Wormhole)</h2>
      <p>
        A 402 is text the payee wrote, and an agent reads it before it pays. The
        MCP server can send each payment request to{" "}

          Agent Wormhole

        first, which scans it for hidden instructions and tells whether it
        changed since it was first seen. The payment goes ahead only on an allow.
        A refusal, an abstain, findings, an error or no answer within five
        seconds all mean the agent does not pay, and nothing is spent.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is off until you turn it on. Put your Agent Wormhole key in the
        server&apos;s settings (<code>~/.gloam/agent.env</code>) or its
        environment:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>GLOAM_WORMHOLE_KEY=your-agent-wormhole-key</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Agent Wormhole sees the payment request and nothing else: never a note,
        a balance, the wallet or a key.

        </a>{" "}
        whether the agent&apos;s budget covers each payment, and only an allow
        pays. A refusal, any other answer, an error, a bad setting or no answer
        within five seconds all mean the agent does not pay, and nothing is
        spent. With Agent Wormhole on too, it goes first, and both must allow.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is off until you turn it on. Put these in the server&apos;s settings
        (<code>~/.gloam/agent.env</code>) or its environment. The agent id is
        one you choose, and a wallet address is refused:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`GLOAM_VEYA_KEY=your-veya-key
GLOAM_VEYA_URL=veya-check-endpoint
GLOAM_VEYA_AGENT_ID=an-id-you-choose`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        With this on, VEYA sees the agent id, asset, amount and payee during the
        check, along with the chain, the resource&apos;s host and the payment
        request. It never sees a note, a secret, a balance, a wallet or a key.
        What VEYA keeps after the check is VEYA&apos;s to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        This server enforces the check, off-chain. The vault does not know about
        it, so it binds the agent only while the notes and the key are held by
        this server and nowhere else. If a payment fails after an allow,
        VEYA&apos;s running budget may sit ahead of what was really paid.
      </p>
      <h3>The receipt after a payment</h3>
      <p>
        VEYA&apos;s allow carries a check id. Set{" "}
        <code>GLOAM_VEYA_ANCHOR_URL</code> as well, and the server proves each
        payment once it lands, with that id as the receipt&apos;s verifier, and
        hashes the proof into one <code>bytes32</code> leaf. VEYA gets that leaf
        and the agent id, nothing else: never the record, the proof, the amount,
        the payee, a note or the transaction hash. VEYA writes the leaf to{" "}
        <code>storeCommitment</code>, so you need no anchoring wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        With receipts on, an allow without a usable check id does not pay,
        because a payment can&apos;t be undone and it could never get its
        receipt. After a payment, nothing can undo it: a receipt or an anchor
        that fails leaves the payment paid, with a status of{" "}
        <code>anchor_failed</code> or <code>receipt_failed</code> in the result,
        and <code>gloam_retry_veya_receipts</code> tries again without paying
        anything. <code>anchored</code> means VEYA took the leaf; the server does
        not read the chain to confirm the write.
      </p>
      <p>
        The server keeps the full record in its encrypted note store. It shows
        the asset, the minimum amount and the transaction hash, so no tool hands
        it to the agent. See <code>examples/veya-receipt</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Spending limits</h2>
      <p>
        An agent that can sign can spend, so the owner sets its limits and every
        tool that moves money (pay, send, shield) checks them before anything is
        proved or signed. A spend that breaks a limit is refused with a plain
        reason the agent can act on, for example &ldquo;that would bring today to
        14 PathUSD, over the limit of 12 a day&rdquo;.
      </p>

        No limits means no spending: a server with a key but no limits refuses
        every spend until you set them (or turn them off on purpose). Every
        spend is logged before it is signed, under a lock, so two calls at once
        cannot both squeeze under the daily cap. Configuration lives in the{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/cryptoduke01/gloam/tree/main/mcp#spending-limits">
          MCP README
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they are enforced.</strong> These limits are enforced by the
        MCP server you run, off-chain, not by the vault contract. They stop a
        confused or manipulated agent; they do not stop someone who has the raw
        key. For that, use a policy wallet underneath, as below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The agent never holds the money itself.</strong> A private balance
        is a note, and whoever knows its secret can spend it, so the server keeps
        every note in an encrypted store and gives the agent short handles
        instead. A payment it makes is sealed to the payee&apos;s receive tag, so
        the agent cannot open that either. What limits still cannot stop: an agent
        tricked into spending within its limits to a payee you allowed.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy and key custody</h2>
      <p>
        Signing keys live <strong>server-side only</strong> and never enter a
        model context or a log. Before an agent runs on mainnet,
        swap the test key for a Turnkey server wallet with policy the agent
        cannot override: spend caps, an
        allow-list of contracts and markets, and size privacy always on. An
        out-of-policy action is refused, not quietly clamped.
      </p>

      <h2>Honesty</h2>
      <p>
        No fabricated fills, ever. If a private path is not live, the tool says so
        and returns a plan rather than a fake success.{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/private-swaps">Private swaps</Link> are live in the
        Gloam app on the Robinhood Chain and Tempo mainnets, but the SDK and the MCP server do not swap
        yet: the market and trade tools only plan, and the old sealed trade they
        describe is retired. Shield, private send, cash out, and disclosure are
        live and proof-gated. Mainnet uses the final keys from the 13-contributor
        ceremony; testnet runs on dev-ceremony keys. The code was reviewed
        internally before launch, and an external audit is planned. Mainnet is
        beta software, so start an agent on small limits.
