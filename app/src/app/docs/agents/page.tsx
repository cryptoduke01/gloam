      <h2>Why agents need this most</h2>
      <p>
        An agent trading a public chain leaks its whole strategy: every position,
        size, and time is on the graph for anyone to copy or front-run. Agents run
        predictable, high-frequency strategies, so they are the easiest to
        reverse-engineer. Gloam gives an agent a private execution surface: hold,
        move, and prove value with size hidden, so its edge stays its own.
      </p>

      <h2>Two ways in</h2>
      <p>
        Both speak the same intent shape, so a plan an app builds and a plan an
        agent builds are the same object.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Directly via <code>@gloamtrade/sdk</code>.</strong> Your agent
          framework builds an intent and signs it with its own wallet. Best when
          the agent already has an execution loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Via the <code>@gloamtrade/mcp</code> server.</strong> An
          MCP-speaking model (Claude, etc.) gets Gloam as tools alongside its
          other capabilities, the same way Robinhood&apos;s own MCP exposes
          public trading. Best for a general assistant that should also act
          privately.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="connect-by-url">Connect by URL</h2>
      <p>
        The quickest way to try Gloam from a chat. Gloam runs a hosted MCP
        server, so you add it to your client by URL and install nothing.

          <strong>ChatGPT</strong>: Settings, Apps and connectors. Turn on
          developer mode, then create a connector with the URL and no

        It never signs, never holds funds, and never needs a private key, a
        recovery phrase or a note secret. A tool call that looks like it carries
        one is refused with a warning not to share it, and nothing is kept. When
        something has to be signed, it sends you to the app, or to the local{" "}

        <code>examples/agent-shield</code> is the smallest complete agent: it
        mints a note, generates the shield proof, and deposits privately via{" "}

      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`import { buildShieldBoundIntent, artifactProver } from "@gloamtrade/sdk";
import { parseEther } from "viem";

// 1) SDK mints the note + generates the shield proof
const intent = await buildShieldBoundIntent({
  amountWei: parseEther("0.001"),
  prover: artifactProver({ wasm: "shield.wasm", zkey: "shield_final.zkey" }),
});

// 2) the agent signs the resolved call with its (server-held) wallet
const hash = await wallet.writeContract({
  address: intent.exec.poolAddress,
  abi: shieldPoolAbi,
  functionName: intent.exec.fn,   // "shieldBound"

        <code>@gloamtrade/mcp</code> exposes Gloam as tools to any MCP client. It keeps

        and describe, in plain language, what is private and what is not;
        execution tools take a plan, sign it server-side, and broadcast.

      <h2>Private agent payments (x402)</h2>
      <p>
        Agents pay for tools and data over HTTP 402. The pattern that won
        Colosseum paired x402 with stablecoins, but that settlement is fully
        public: the amount, the payer, and the payee all leak. Gloam&apos;s{" "}
        <code>gloam-private</code> scheme keeps it private and self-custodial. The
        agent settles a shielded transfer to the payee itself, so no operator or
        facilitator ever holds its key or funds, then presents the payment note,
        sealed to the payee&apos;s receive tag, plus the settlement transaction on
        the 402 retry. The payee opens the note and moves it into a fresh note
        only it knows before serving, so the payer cannot spend it back. The
        public sees only shielded transfers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This is not a Tempo Zone.</strong> A Zone is operator-visible:
        the zone operator sees every transaction inside it. Gloam is private from
        the public and from any operator; only the payer and the payee learn the
        amount. Compliance visibility is opt-in per payment through an
        issuer-scoped disclosure, not a blanket view handed to an operator. See
        the <Link href="/docs/privacy-model">privacy model</Link> for what stays
        hidden and what does not.
      </p>

      <h2>Spending limits</h2>
      <p>
        An agent that can sign can spend, so the owner sets its limits and every
        tool that moves money (pay, send, shield) checks them before anything is
        proved or signed. A spend that breaks a limit is refused with a plain
        reason the agent can act on, for example &ldquo;that would bring today to
        14 PathUSD, over the limit of 12 a day&rdquo;.
      </p>

      <p>
        No limits means no spending: a server with a key but no limits refuses
        every spend until you set them (or turn them off on purpose). Every
        spend is logged before it is signed, under a lock, so two calls at once
        cannot both squeeze under the daily cap. Configuration lives in the{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/cryptoduke01/gloam/tree/main/mcp#spending-limits">
          MCP README
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they are enforced.</strong> These limits are enforced by the
        MCP server you run, off-chain, not by the vault contract. They stop a
        confused or manipulated agent; they do not stop someone who has the raw
        key. For that, use a policy wallet underneath, as below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The agent never holds the money itself.</strong> A private balance
        is a note, and whoever knows its secret can spend it, so the server keeps
        every note in an encrypted store and gives the agent short handles
        instead. A payment it makes is sealed to the payee&apos;s receive tag, so
        the agent cannot open that either. What limits still cannot stop: an agent
        tricked into spending within its limits to a payee you allowed.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy and key custody</h2>
      <p>
        Signing keys live <strong>server-side only</strong> and never enter a
        model context or a log. For production, swap the testnet key for a Turnkey
        server wallet with policy the agent cannot override: spend caps, an
        allow-list of contracts and markets, and size privacy always on. An
        out-of-policy action is refused, not quietly clamped.
      </p>

      <h2>Honesty</h2>
      <p>
        No fabricated fills, ever. If a private path is not live, the tool says so
        and returns a plan rather than a fake success. Sealed swaps are currently
        disabled pending the H1 solvency work; shield, private send, cash out, and
        disclosure are live and proof-gated. Testnet only, with dev-ceremony keys,
        until a production ceremony and an external audit.
