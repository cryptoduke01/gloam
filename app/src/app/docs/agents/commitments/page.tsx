      <h2 id="why">Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        A game city, a marketplace or an agent network can keep its books off
        chain and still be checkable: it commits a root of its records each
        night, and anyone can prove a record is in it. Payments are the part that
        usually stays fully public, because they settle in public stablecoin
        transfers. That shows every agent&apos;s suppliers, prices and balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is how private payments stay compatible with the
        commitments you already post. The answer is that each private payment
        leaves a proof you can commit to, exactly like any other record.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how">How it fits</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Pay privately.</strong> The paying agent sends a private
          payment from its private balance to the payee&apos;s Gloam address. It
          is a real vault transaction the agent signs itself. On chain it shows
          a nullifier and two commitments, no amount and no payee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The payee secures it.</strong> The payee opens the payment and
          moves it into a note only it knows. Until then the payer could still
          spend it back, so the payment is final only after this sweep.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prove it.</strong> The payer proves the payment with the receipt
          circuit: a private payment of this asset, at least this much (or
          exactly this much, if you choose), is in the vault. The proof is bound
          to a label you pick, such as a record id, and an expiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commit it.</strong> You hash that proof into one{" "}
          <code>bytes32</code> leaf and put it in your nightly root with your
          other records.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check it, any time.</strong> Anyone holding the record checks
          the leaf is in the root, the proof is valid, the vault had that state,
          and the named transaction made the payment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Public transfers you rely on stay public. If your economy burns tokens
        on each sale and reads that trail, keep sending the burn as a normal
        token transfer next to the private payment.
      </p>

      <h2 id="pay">Pay and plan the receipt</h2>
      <p>
        <code>buildPrivatePaymentWithReceipt</code> builds the private send to a
        receive tag, seals the payment so only the payee opens it, and returns
        the plan for the receipt. It signs and sends nothing.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`import {
  mainnetNetwork, buildPrivatePaymentWithReceipt, buildPaymentReceipt,
  POOL_TRANSFER_ABI, transferCallArgs, syncTree, artifactProver, proveGroth16,
} from "@gloamtrade/sdk";

const net = mainnetNetwork("robinhood")!;

const pay = await buildPrivatePaymentWithReceipt({
  payTo: supplierTag,                      // the payee's gloamr1.… address
  chainId: net.chainId,
  asset: usdg.address,
  amountWei: parseUnits("25", 6),
  from: { secretHex: note.secret, amountWei: note.amount, path },  // the payer's private note
  prove: transferProver,                   // artifactProver over transfer.wasm + final/transfer_final.zkey
  note: "order 8812",                      // only the payee reads it
  receipt: { verifier: "nightly-root:sale:8812" },  // sealed into the proof
});

// The agent signs the private send, then posts the sealed payment for the payee.
const txHash = await wallet.writeContract({
  address: net.pool, abi: POOL_TRANSFER_ABI, functionName: "transfer", args: transferCallArgs(pay.intent),
});
if (pay.memo) await wallet.writeContract(pay.memo);
// Keep pay.changeNote: it is the rest of the agent's balance.`}</code>
      </pre>

      <h2 id="prove">Prove it and make the leaf</h2>
      <p>
        Once the transfer has landed, sync the tree and prove. This works after
        the payee has swept the payment too.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`const synced = await syncTree(client, { pool: net.pool, fromBlock: net.deployBlock });
const record = await buildPaymentReceipt({
  plan: pay.receiptPlan,
  path: (await synced.pathForCommitment(pay.paymentNote.commitment))!,
  txHash,
  prove: (input) => proveGroth16(input, "receipt.wasm", "final/receipt_final.zkey"),
});

record.leaf   // the bytes32 to put in tonight's root
// Store the record next to it, off chain. It holds no secret.`}</code>
      </pre>

      <h2 id="leaf">The leaf, exactly</h2>
      <pre>
        <code>{`keccak256(abi.encode(
  string  "gloam.receipt-leaf.v1",
  uint256 chainId,
  address pool,           // the vault
  bytes32 txHash,         // the vault transfer that made the payment
  uint256[7] signals      // the receipt's public signals, in circuit order:
                          // [root, commitment, asset, minAmount, reveal, shownAmount, context]
))`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        <code>abi.encode</code>, not <code>encodePacked</code>. In Solidity it is
        one line, and a contract can recompute it from the record:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encode("gloam.receipt-leaf.v1", chainId, pool, txHash, signals)); // uint256[7]`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In TypeScript it is <code>paymentReceiptLeaf(record)</code>, and{" "}
        <code>verifyPaymentReceiptLeaf(leaf, record)</code> recomputes and
        compares. The SDK&apos;s tests pin a vector that Solidity and{" "}
        <code>cast</code> both reproduce. A new encoding would get a new domain
        tag, never a silent change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>context</code> signal is{" "}
        <code>proofContext(&#123; kind: &quot;payment&quot;, chainId, pool, verifier, expiresAt &#125;)</code>,
        so the leaf also commits to the label and expiry. Treat the leaf as one
        more value in your tree: if your tree hashes leaves again, hash this one
        the same way.
      </p>

      <h2 id="check">Checking a record</h2>
      <p>
        <code>checkPaymentReceipt(record, &#123; verifySnark, client &#125;)</code>{" "}
        runs every check and reports each one. <code>ok</code> is true only when
        all eight ran and passed. Check the leaf against your root with your own
        merkle proof, as for any record.

      <p>
        A record is also a Gloam proof of payment:{" "}
        <code>paymentProofText(record)</code> gives <code>gloampay1:…</code>,
        which anyone can paste into <Link href="/verify">/verify</Link> or check
        through the <Link href="/docs/partners">partner API</Link>. The record
        has an expiry (30 days by default). Your root does not expire, so{" "}

      <h2 id="allowlist">What an agent signs</h2>
      <p>
        If your agents sign only from an allowlist,{" "}

        every call they sign to use Gloam on a chain, with the contract, the
        signature, the selector and the rules to enforce. Native value is 0 on
        every one.

        A payment needs only <code>transfer</code> and <code>postMemo</code>, and{" "}
        <code>postMemo</code> is optional: an economy that already passes
        messages between agents can hand the payee the sealed payment directly.
        The vault checks a proof on <code>shieldBound</code>,{" "}
        <code>transfer</code> and <code>unshield</code> that binds every
        argument, so an edited call reverts instead of sending money elsewhere.

      <h2 id="public">What is public and what is not</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Public:</strong> deposits (amount and asset), cash outs
          (amount, asset, recipient), public transfers such as burns, your
          nightly root, and that an agent&apos;s wallet sent a vault transaction
          at a given time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Private:</strong> how much each payment was, who received it,
          and each agent&apos;s private balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The signer shows.</strong> An agent that signs its own vault
          transfer is that transaction&apos;s sender: the amount and the payee
          stay hidden, the fact that it paid someone privately does not. The
          Gloam relay (<code>relayIntent</code>, <code>relayMemo</code>) sends it
          instead, and can only submit or refuse, never redirect money.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Records show what is in them.</strong> Whoever sees a record
          sees its asset, its minimum (or amount, if revealed) and its
          transaction hash. Publish only the root to keep records private.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A receipt does not show who got paid.</strong> The payer picks
          the payment note&apos;s key, so both sides can make the same proof. Who
          the payment was for comes from your record and its label.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="limits">Limits worth knowing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No on-chain receipt verifier.</strong> The vault verifies the
          deposit, transfer and cash-out proofs it takes. Receipt proofs are
          checked off chain, with snarkjs and the published checking key. A
          contract can recompute the leaf and check your merkle path today;
          checking the receipt proof itself on chain would need a receipt
          verifier contract, which does not exist yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Beta.</strong> Mainnet runs on the final keys of the
          13-contributor trusted setup, with beta deposit limits. It had an
          internal review on 20 October 2026; an external audit is planned and
          not done. Start small.
