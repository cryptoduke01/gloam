      <h2>How the program works</h2>
      <p>
        Your users keep their own keys and their own money. They prove each payment
        in their browser or agent with the <Link href="/docs/sdk">SDK</Link>. Your
        server sends the proven payment through the Gloam relay with your API key,
        and that is how a payment is counted to you.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sign in</strong> at <Link href="/partners/dashboard">/partners/dashboard</Link>{" "}
          with your wallet. You sign a short message (Sign-In with Ethereum); it
          costs nothing and moves no money.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make a key.</strong> It is shown once. Gloam keeps only a keyed
          fingerprint of it (HMAC-SHA256 with a server secret), so nobody can read
          it back. Rename, rotate (a new secret, the old one stops at once) or
          revoke it any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set your fee</strong> and a payout address per network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relay payments with the key.</strong> The portal shows your
          volume, your would-be fees and every payment, updated every 20 seconds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What you can charge, and why</h2>
      <div className="overflow-x-auto">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>

      <p>
        Fees are in the token the user moved, paid to your payout address on that
        network. A payment message (the encrypted heads-up after a private
        payment) carries no fee. A change to your setting applies to new payments;
        earlier ones keep the fee they were counted with.
      </p>

      <h2>Testnet: nothing is charged</h2>
      <p>
        Gloam runs on Robinhood Chain testnet and Tempo testnet. Today the portal
        records what your key brought in and the fee your setting would have earned,
        and every figure is labeled that way. No fee is taken from anyone, and every
        API response says <code>&quot;charged&quot;: false</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking a fee for real needs a fee output inside the zero-knowledge circuits
        and the vault contract, so the fee is part of the proof and nobody can skip
        or change it. That is part of the mainnet ceremony and audit (see the{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/production">production gate</Link>). Until then, a
        dashboard figure is an attribution count, not money owed.
      </p>
      <p>
        USD figures use $1 for stablecoins and the live ETH price at the time of the
        payment. Stock tokens are counted but not valued.
      </p>

      <h2>Authentication and limits</h2>
      <p>
        Send the key in the <code>Authorization</code> header on every call except
        the index at <code>GET /api/v1</code>. Test keys (<code>gloam_test_</code>)
        work on testnets; live keys (<code>gloam_live_</code>) open with mainnet.
        Keep the key on your server: the API sends no CORS headers, so browsers on
        other sites cannot call it.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`curl https://gloam.trade/api/v1/me \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GLOAM_API_KEY"`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Each key gets 300 requests a minute across every endpoint. Responses carry{" "}
        <code>X-RateLimit-Limit</code>, <code>X-RateLimit-Remaining</code> and{" "}
        <code>X-RateLimit-Reset</code> (unix seconds); a 429 adds{" "}
        <code>Retry-After</code>. The relay also keeps its own per-sender and
        per-network caps, with your key as the sender.
      </p>

      <h2>Responses and errors</h2>
      <p>
        Every response is JSON in the same envelope, with{" "}
        <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code> and a <code>Gloam-Api-Version: 1</code>{" "}
        header. Quote the <code>requestId</code> when you ask us about a call.
      </p>

      <h2>Relay a payment</h2>
      <p>
        <code>POST /api/v1/relay</code> takes the same body as the app&apos;s own
        relay. It screens, dry-runs and submits exactly as the app does, then
        counts the payment to you. The proof is the authorization and a cash
        out&apos;s recipient is fixed inside it, so the relay can only submit or
        refuse a payment, never redirect it.
      </p>
      <pre>

        The hash comes back as soon as the transaction is sent; wait for the

        that was sent is never failed over accounting. <code>GET /api/v1/relay</code>{" "}
        says which networks the relay can submit on right now.
      </p>

      <h2>Count a deposit</h2>
      <p>
        Deposits come from the user&apos;s own wallet, not the relay, so your app
        reports them: <code>POST /api/v1/deposits</code> with the transaction hash.
        The server reads the transaction from the chain. It must be a successful
        deposit into Gloam&apos;s vault, at most 24 hours old, and not already
        counted to anyone; the first partner to report it gets it.
      </p>

      <h2>Your volume and fees</h2>
      <p>
        <code>GET /api/v1/activity?limit=50</code> returns what the portal shows:

      <p>
        <code>GET /api/v1/vaults</code> (or <code>/vaults/robinhood</code>,{" "}
        <code>/vaults/tempo</code>) gives each network&apos;s vault address, the
        tokens it takes, whether the relay is up, and a fresh read of the tree size
        and root.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>GET /api/v1/vaults/&#123;network&#125;/leaves</code> is the vault&apos;s
        public leaf list: every commitment in order, with its leaf index, block and
        transaction. Rebuild the Merkle tree from it and check the root with the
        pool&apos;s <code>isKnownRoot</code> before you prove against it; the SDK&apos;s{" "}
        <code>syncTree</code> does the same from the chain.

      <p>
        <code>POST /api/v1/payment-requests</code> makes a link that opens Pay in the

        This endpoint builds the link and keeps nothing; you can also build the same
