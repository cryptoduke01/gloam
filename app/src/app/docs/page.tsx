      <h2 id="what">What is Gloam?</h2>
      <p>
        Stablecoins are becoming how businesses and AI agents pay each other,
        and every one of those payments is public. Gloam makes them private,
        and lets the payer prove exactly what someone needs to see. Private by
        default, provable on demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        It runs on <strong>Tempo</strong> and <strong>Robinhood Chain</strong>{" "}
        testnets. You put money into a shared vault (“shield”), pay privately
        inside it, and cash out with a real proof. Proofs are made on your
        device, and nobody else holds a key. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/compare">how Gloam compares</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now everything is <strong>testnet</strong>, play money,{" "}
        <strong>development proving keys</strong>. No real dollars.
