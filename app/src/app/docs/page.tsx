      <h2 id="what">What is Gloam?</h2>
      <p>
        Stablecoins are becoming how businesses and AI agents pay each other,
        and every one of those payments is public. Gloam makes them private,
        and lets the payer prove exactly what someone needs to see. Private by
        default, provable on demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        It runs on <strong>{MAINNETS}</strong> mainnet, and on four testnets:
        Robinhood Chain testnet, Tempo Moderato, Base Sepolia and Ethereum
        Sepolia. You
        put money into a shared vault (“shield”), pay privately inside it, and
        cash out with a real proof. Proofs are made on your device, and nobody
        else holds a key. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/compare">how Gloam compares</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mainnet is <strong>beta software</strong>. It uses
        the final keys from a 13-contributor trusted setup, and beta deposit
        limits cap what goes in. The code was reviewed internally before
        launch; an external audit is planned. Direct deposits and private payments
        are free, and cashing out costs 0.5%. The Robinhood Chain and Tempo
        testnets keep <strong>development proving keys</strong>; Base Sepolia
        and Ethereum Sepolia run the final keys. Details: <Link href="/docs/chain">Networks</Link>.
