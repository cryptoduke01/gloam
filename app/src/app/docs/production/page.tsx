      <h2>Why this page exists</h2>
      <p>
        Mainnet is beta software, so we keep a plain list of
        what had to be true before it opened, what is in place now, and what is
        not done yet. The app proves shield, unshield, and private send in the
        browser, and that is real cryptography. On mainnet the proofs use the
        final keys from the production trusted setup (see the{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/cryptoduke01/gloam/releases/tag/ceremony-final">transcript</a>).
        The Robinhood Chain and Tempo testnets keep development keys, which
        are <strong>not</strong> safe for mainnet, so they stay testnet only.
        Base Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia run the final keys.

      <h2>Ceremony checklist (keys)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Done: phase 1 is the public Hermez Powers of Tau (54 contributors)</li>
        <li>
          Done: phase 2, 13 contributions to shield, unshield, transfer,
          solvency, receipt and payroll_total, each round a public release
        </li>
        <li>
          Done: the final keys and their Solidity verifiers, exported byte for byte
          (<code>contracts/src/verifiers/final</code>), same public inputs layout v2
        </li>
        <li>
          Done: their SHA-256 fingerprints are pinned, and each network proves with its own
          set: dev keys on the Robinhood Chain and Tempo testnets, the final
          keys on mainnet, Base Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia
        </li>
        <li>
          Done: the mainnet deploy refuses to create a pool unless its verifiers accept
          proofs made with the final keys and reject proofs made with the dev keys
        </li>
        <li>Destroy or never re-use toxic waste from the ceremony</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mainnet at launch</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pools.</strong> <code>ShieldPoolPayments</code> on Robinhood
          Chain (4663) and Tempo (4217).
          {LATER ? ` ${LATER} joined later on the same deploy and keys.` : ""}{" "}
          Addresses and assets are on{" "}
          <Link href="/docs/chain#mainnet">Networks</Link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Beta deposit limits.</strong> Each stablecoin: 500 per deposit
          and 25,000 in total. $GLOAM: 25,000 per deposit and 250,000 in total.
          Cash outs and private payments are never limited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No admin withdraw.</strong> No function lets the team take
          pooled funds. Notes leave only through an unshield proof.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fees.</strong> Deposits and private payments are free. A cash
          out costs 0.25%. Half of Gloam&apos;s fees buy back $GLOAM; half of
          that is burned and half goes to the treasury.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What was hardened before mainnet</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Real on-chain verifiers (no always-true mock on the funded pool)</li>
        <li>Browser prove path with artifact hash checks</li>
        <li>Private send does not keep the payment note on the sender</li>
        <li>Hardened pool: a bound shield proof and 128-bit amount range checks (audit C1/C2)</li>
        <li>Two-step ownership and a one-way shield-verifier set (audit M-4)</li>
        <li>
          Note secrets and receive keys encrypted at rest (AES-GCM under an
          IndexedDB device key, or that key wrapped by a passkey, audit M-1)
        </li>
        <li>
          Claimed payments secured on claim: moved into a fresh note only the
          payee knows, so the payer cannot spend them back
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is still ahead</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>External review beyond the vault.</strong> The{" "}
          <Link href="/security">Kann Audits report</Link> covers the vault
          contracts only. The swap routers, circuits, app and relay were not
          part of it. Beta limits cap how much the pools can hold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multisig owner.</strong> One wallet is the owner (
          <code>0x76b7E410a227c888aBD2Bdc24Ee32E094B0FD4D8</code>). Cash-out
          fees go to the treasury (
          <code>0xB3900ac9350903218e4c7597bAb0f008F01B30B8</code>) since 24
          October. A multisig is planned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Owner guard.</strong> Ownership of each mainnet vault moves
          to VaultOwnerGuard, which forwards deposit limit and fee changes
          and the sweep of coin sent by mistake, and nothing else. It applies to a vault from the moment the guard accepts it,
          after outside review: from then on that vault&apos;s proof checkers
          and ownership can never change. Read <code>owner()</code> on the
          vault to see whether it has. What that costs is in the{" "}
          <Link href="/docs/threat-model">threat model</Link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relayer.</strong> The Gloam team runs it at launch. It only
          submits already-proven transactions and pays gas; it cannot move or
          redirect money. If it is down, you can send from your own wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anonymity set.</strong> The mainnet pools are new, so the
          crowd of notes to hide among is thin at first. It grows with use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Swap amounts.</strong> A{" "}
          <Link href="/docs/private-swaps">private swap</Link> hides who
          swapped, not the tokens or the amounts. The old sealed trade, which
          tried to hide the size too, is retired and stays off
        </li>
        {!BASE_LIVE && (
          <li>
            <strong>Base mainnet.</strong> Next on the same deploy script and
            final keys. Base Sepolia, its testnet, has run it since 24
            October; Base mainnet follows once that is tested end to end. See{" "}
            <Link href="/docs/chain#base">Networks</Link>.
          </li>
        )}
        {!ETHEREUM_LIVE && (
          <li>
            <strong>Ethereum mainnet.</strong> Next on the same deploy script
            and final keys. Ethereum Sepolia, its testnet, has run it since 25
            October. The relay pays Ethereum gas only under its ceiling, 3 gwei
            by default, and waits above it. See{" "}
            <Link href="/docs/chain#ethereum">Networks</Link>.
          </li>
        )}
        <li>
          <strong>Stronger key custody.</strong> Notes and receive keys are encrypted at rest, but
          the key is device-bound; a wallet-bound or passphrase key is still open
        </li>
