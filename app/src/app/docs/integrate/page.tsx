      </p>

      <h2 id="preview">Preview, then execute</h2>
      <p>
        Every action that moves money or shows something about it is two
        calls. A preview checks the request against the chain and the
        owner&apos;s limits and returns exactly what will happen, with a{" "}
        <code>previewId</code> and a <code>digest</code>. Nothing moves until{" "}
        <code>gloam_execute</code> runs it.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`{
  "status": "preview",
  "previewId": "pv_Xq3...",
  "digest": "sha256:9c1e...",
  "action": "cash_out",
  "summary": "Cash out 100 USDG to 0xAbc... on Robinhood Chain mainnet: 99.5 USDG arrives after the 0.5% fee.",
  "details": {
    "amount": "100 USDG",
    "to": "0xAbc...",
    "fee": { "bps": 50, "percent": "0.5%", "amount": "0.5 USDG" },
    "receives": "99.5 USDG"
  },
  "walletSigns": [],
  "submittedBy": "the Gloam relay, which pays the gas (your wallet does not appear next to it)"
}`}</code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Execute runs the preview, not new input.</strong> Amount,
          asset, recipient, network and fee are bound when the preview is made
          and hashed into the digest. Pass the digest you approved and a
          different preview is refused.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Once.</strong> A second execute returns the first result. A
          preview expires after 10 minutes, and a cash out whose fee changed
          since is refused.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The wallet signs only what the preview named.</strong> Your
          wallet sits behind a guard: outside a running preview it signs
          nothing, and a deposit may sign only an approve of the vault for
          exactly the amount and one deposit of exactly that asset and amount.{" "}
          <code>onSign</code> sees each batch decoded and can still say no.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proofs authorize the rest.</strong> Private payments and cash
          outs are proven on your machine and sent by the Gloam relay, so the
          wallet signs only deposits. The relay can send or refuse; it cannot
          move or redirect money.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="secrets">Secrets stay with the kit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A note&apos;s secret is the money. Secrets stay in an encrypted note
          store (AES-256-GCM), a local file by default or your own storage
          through <code>noteBackend</code>, which only ever sees ciphertext.
        </li>
        <li>Tools hand out handles and public facts, and every result is checked for secrets before it leaves.</li>
        <li>
          Claim links go to <code>onClaimLink</code> or are sealed to a Gloam
          address. A tool result never carries one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spending limits are the owner&apos;s: per asset, per payment, per 24
          hours, recipients and an expiry, checked before anything is signed.
          They are enforced by this code, not by the vault contract.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="mcp">Or bundle the Gloam MCP server</h2>
      <p>A kit that composes MCP servers can run Gloam&apos;s next to its own, with no code:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gloam": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gloamtrade/mcp"],
      "env": { "GLOAM_ENV_FILE": "/home/agent/.gloam/agent.env" }
    }
  }
}`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Keys and limits go in that file, not in the client config. The server
        shields, pays privately, pays x402 and MPP resources, checks payments
        it is paid and runs private swaps. Its execute tools run directly, so
        the approval step is your MCP client&apos;s tool approval, and it has no
        claim link, cash out or proof of funds tool yet. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/agents">Agents</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="marketplaces">For x402 marketplaces</h2>
      <p>
        A seller keeps its standard x402 <code>exact</code> price and adds a
        Gloam price next to it. Agents that can pay privately do; the rest keep
        paying the normal way.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Standard clients are not affected.</strong> They never see or
          pay the Gloam price. x402 v1 clients parse the 402 body&apos;s{" "}
          <code>accepts</code> strictly, so the Gloam price rides in its own{" "}
          <code>X-Payment-Required</code> header and the body stays as it was.
          On x402 v2 it is also added to <code>PAYMENT-REQUIRED</code>, where
          clients skip schemes they do not know.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Paying privately takes a client that supports{" "}
          <code>gloam-private</code></strong>: the tool pack, the Gloam MCP
          server, or the SDK. There is no plugin for the standard x402 SDKs
          today.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The seller secures a payment before it serves.</strong> The
          buyer made the payment note, so it could spend it back until the
          seller moves it. The helper opens the payment with the seller&apos;s
          key, checks it against this route&apos;s price, sweeps it into a fresh
          note only the seller knows, and serves once that is in the vault. Each
          payment is served once.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>
        <code>{`import { generateReceiveKey } from "@gloamtrade/sdk";

      <h2 id="gloam-cashout">Private payer, public payee (gloam-cashout)</h2>
      <p>
        Some gateways pay out to a public address, such as a creator&apos;s
        splitter, and settle standard <code>exact</code> payments in USDG on
        Robinhood Chain. With <code>gloam-cashout</code> the agent pays from its
        private balance: it cashes out straight to that address. The chain
        shows USDG leaving the Gloam vault to the splitter. It does not show the
        agent&apos;s wallet, because the Gloam relay sends the cash out, or which
        deposit paid for it. The payee side stays public, as it is today.
      </p>
      <h3>The 402</h3>
      <p>Add one entry to <code>accepts</code>, next to <code>exact</code>:</p>

          (50 today) and <code>tag</code> is 1 to 9999, unique per open quote.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The vault takes its fee.</strong> The vault at{" "}
          <code>0x39E28Cde55CAB798874746ac52cb4B5Cc99a0194</code> keeps{" "}
          <code>floor(G * bps / 10000)</code> and sends the rest to{" "}
          <code>payTo</code>. That is always at least the price.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>quoteGross(price, tag)</code> in <code>@gloamtrade/sdk</code>{" "}
          reads the fee and returns G. Read it per quote: the fee can change
          on a 3-day timelock.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The payment</h3>
      <p>
        The agent cashes out exactly G of USDG to <code>payTo</code>. The vault
        emits <code>Unshielded(nullifier, asset, to, amount)</code> with{" "}
        <code>amount = G</code>. The agent then retries with:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>{`X-PAYMENT: base64(JSON.stringify({ scheme: "gloam-cashout", txHash, quoteId }))`}</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The header holds a public tx hash and your own quote id. It never holds
        a note, a key or a balance. The tool pack, the Gloam MCP server&apos;s{" "}
        <code>gloam_fetch_paid</code> and <code>GloamAgent.payX402Cashout</code>{" "}
        pay it, and all three need a <code>maxAmount</code>. When a 402 offers
        both <code>gloam-private</code> and <code>gloam-cashout</code>, they pay{" "}
        <code>gloam-private</code> unless the caller prefers{" "}
        <code>gloam-cashout</code>.
      </p>
      <h3>The gateway check</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The receipt exists on chain 4663 and succeeded.</li>
        <li>

          any other contract does not count.
        </li>
        <li>
          It has a USDG <code>Transfer</code> from the vault to{" "}
          <code>payTo</code> of at least the price.
        </li>
        <li>The block time falls inside the quote window.</li>
        <li>
          You have not seen the txHash before. Keep that store yourself, and

        Make a partner key at{" "}
        <Link href="/partners/dashboard">/partners/dashboard</Link> and pass it
        as <code>apiKey</code> to the tool pack or the seller helper. Private
        payments, cash outs and sweeps then go through the partner relay, and
        deposits are attributed once they land, so the dashboard counts what
        your kit or marketplace brings in. Partner fees are not charged yet. See
        the <Link href="/docs/partners">Partner API</Link>.

      <ul>
        <li>
          A deposit and a cash out are public: the wallet or recipient, the
          asset and the amount. A private payment shows only that a shielded
          transfer happened.
        </li>
        <li>Deposits and private payments are free. A cash out costs 0.5%.</li>
        <li>
          Mainnets: Robinhood Chain, Tempo, Base and Ethereum, with
          deposit limits (50,000 of a stablecoin per deposit). Every network
          has a testnet; see <Link href="/docs/chain">Networks</Link>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Privacy grows with the number of notes in a vault, so a quick deposit
          and cash out of the same amount can be linked. See{" "}

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Does Gloam hold my users&apos; money?</h3>
      <p>
        No. The money sits in the vault contract, which has no admin withdraw
        and timelocks its rule changes, and only the agent holds the secrets to
        its notes.
      </p>
      <h3>Do my users need a Gloam account?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Each agent gets a Gloam address from the pack, kept in its own note
        store. Someone with no Gloam address can be paid by claim link.
      </p>
      <h3>Has it been reviewed?</h3>
      <p>
        Kann Audits reviewed the vault contracts (
        <Link href="/security">report, 1 November 2026</Link>) and Hey Research
        Lab reviewed the stack. The tool pack and the seller helper are new;
        read them before you trust them with money, and start on small limits.
