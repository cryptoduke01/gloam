      <h2 id="two-jobs">Two jobs, two kinds of privacy</h2>
      <p>
        A sealed auction, a private order book or a lending pool has to work on
        many people&apos;s hidden data at once. Somebody has to do that work.
        So FHE networks like Zama and MPC networks like Arcium use a committee
        of nodes that hold the keys together.
      </p>
      <p>
        A payment is different. It has one owner. The owner can prove the
        payment is valid on their own device with a zero-knowledge proof, and
        nobody else ever holds a key. That is the job Gloam does.
      </p>

      <FlowDiagram
        title="Who holds the key"
        steps={[
          {
            n: "A",
            title: "Committee model",
            body: "Zama, Arcium, Tempo Zones. A committee or an operator holds the key, or sees inside.",
          },
          {
            n: "B",
            title: "Owner model",
            body: "Gloam. Your device makes the proof. Nobody else holds a key, including us.",
          },
        ]}
      />

      <h2 id="breach">What a breach exposes</h2>
      <p>
        If a committee or an operator is breached, everyone who used it can be
        exposed, past payments included. If one owner&apos;s device is
        breached, one person is exposed. That is the whole argument for doing
        payments the owner way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also means Gloam never needs your secrets on a server. Proofs are
        made on your device, never on our servers.
      </p>

      <h2 id="not-new-cryptography">Not new cryptography</h2>
      <p>
        Gloam does not invent new maths. It uses the zero-knowledge proofs of
        the Zcash lineage: notes, nullifiers, a Merkle tree and Groth16 proofs.
        Then it builds the payments product on top, the way Stripe built on
        card networks. What is new is the product layer. See{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/privacy-model#whats-new">what is new and what is not</Link>.

      <h2 id="table">Side by side</h2>
      <p>
        &quot;Not found&quot; means we did not find it in their public docs as
        of October 2026. It does not mean it cannot be built.

      <h2 id="each">Gloam and each of them</h2>

      <h3>Zama</h3>
      <p>
        Zama uses fully homomorphic encryption. Tokens stay encrypted and a
        coprocessor network computes on them. A 13-node key management
        committee shares one global key. Zama has raised over $170M, including
        a token sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they win:</strong> computing on shared data, like sealed
        auctions and lending. <strong>Where Gloam differs:</strong> a payment
        has one owner, so there is no committee and no global key.
      </p>

      <h3>Arcium</h3>
      <p>
        Arcium uses multi-party computation on Solana. Clusters of nodes compute
        on secret shares, and data stays private while at least one node in the
        cluster stays honest. Clusters are admitted by an authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they win:</strong> private shared state on Solana.{" "}
        <strong>Where Gloam differs:</strong> no cluster to trust, and it runs on
        {MAINNETS}.
      </p>

      <h3>Tempo Zones</h3>
      <p>
        Zones are operator-run private chains on Tempo. The operator sees
        everything inside its zone, and deposits and withdrawals are public.
        Zones are in a limited preview.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they win:</strong> enterprises that want an operator in
        the loop. <strong>Where Gloam differs:</strong> self-custody with no
        operator, open to anyone a Zone does not serve.
      </p>

      <h3>Helius Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Helius Privacy is on Solana devnet. Helius&apos;s server generates the
        proofs, so it receives the full secret inputs, amounts included.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they win:</strong> speed on weak phones, and reach on
        Solana. <strong>Where Gloam differs:</strong> proofs are made on your
        device, never on our servers.
      </p>

      <h3>Railgun</h3>
      <p>
        Railgun is the closest to Gloam in design: client-side zero-knowledge
        proofs, on Ethereum and L2s. It holds about $113M and charges 0.25% in
        and out. Its viewing keys show your whole history to whoever holds
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they win:</strong> years live, a far bigger crowd of
        notes, and external audits. <strong>Where Gloam differs:</strong>{" "}
        proofs for one reader that expire, payroll total proofs, agent payments,
        and {MAINNETS}.
      </p>

      <h3 id="nullmask">Nullmask</h3>
      <p>
        Nullmask keeps a private balance in a pool contract. Its docs list
        Ethereum and Base (<Src href={NM.docsNetworks}>networks</Src>), and its
        October 2026 audit report also names BNB Chain and Robinhood Chain. Its
        servers create and keep each user&apos;s viewing and receiving keys and
        prepare the proofs (<Src href={NM.privacyPolicy}>privacy policy</Src>).
        Its docs say it protects activity &quot;from outside observers, not
        from the operator&quot; (<Src href={NM.docsPrivacy}>what stays private</Src>).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Where they win:</strong> signing one message restores the
        account on any device (<Src href={NM.docsStart}>getting started</Src>),
        and the user docs are
        short and plain. <strong>Where Gloam differs:</strong> the keys and the
        proofs stay on your device, so there is no operator that can read a
        balance, the vault cannot be upgraded, and nobody can pause withdrawals.

      <h2 id="swaps">What about trading?</h2>
      <p>
        A trade mixes many people&apos;s orders, which is the committee job
        above. Gloam keeps the owner model for swaps too. A{" "}
        <Link href="/docs/private-swaps">private swap</Link> spends one note
        with one proof made on your device, trades on a public DEX, and puts

      <h2 id="short-version">The short version</h2>
      <p>
        We found no other product on Tempo or Robinhood Chain that combines

      <h2 id="behind">Where Gloam is behind</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>New on mainnet.</strong> Gloam went live on mainnet on 21
          October 2026, on the final keys from a 13-contributor ceremony, with
          beta deposit limits on what the pools take. It is beta software.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internal review only.</strong> Several rounds, with fixes
          deployed, and a review before launch that finished on 20 October with
          no Critical or High findings open. An external audit is in progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Small crowd.</strong> The mainnet pools are new, so the
          anonymity set is thin at first. Treat unlinkability as weak for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Forwarded proofs.</strong> A reader can still pass a proof on.
          It will say who it was for and when it expired. A designated-verifier
          mode is next.

          <strong>Rule changes.</strong> There is no admin withdraw, and rule
