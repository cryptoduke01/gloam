        All three steps run in one transaction. If any step fails, the whole
        swap reverts and nothing moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gloam relay sends the transaction and pays its network fee, so your
        wallet never signs it or shows up next to it. Swaps always go through
        the relay. Sending one from your own wallet would put your wallet right
        next to the swap, so the app does not offer it.

        cannot be swapped there.

      <h2 id="private-public">What stays private and what is public</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Private:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who swapped. The Gloam relay sends it, so your wallet never shows.</li>
        <li>
          Which private balance it came from. The proof shows you own a note in
          the vault, not which one.
        </li>
        <li>Where the new balance goes next. It is a fresh note only you know.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Public:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two tokens and the two amounts, as with any trade on a DEX.</li>
        <li>When it happened, and that it went through the Gloam swap router.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the explorer, one swap shows as the relay calling the router, the
        vault paying a one-time escrow address, a trade on the DEX, and a
        deposit from the router back into the vault. A private swap hides you,
        not the trade.
      </p>

      <h2 id="tips">Keep a swap from linking back to you</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Don&apos;t swap exactly what you deposited.</strong> A swap the
          same size as a recent deposit is easy to match to it. Swap a
          different amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Don&apos;t cash out exactly what you received.</strong>{" "}
          A cash
          out of the swap&apos;s exact output can be matched to the swap. Send it
          on, or cash out a different amount.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mind the crowd.</strong> The mainnet vaults are new, so there
          are few notes to hide among for now.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="one-note">One note per swap</h2>
      <p>
        Your private balance can be made of several notes: each deposit,
        payment you claimed, or change from a payment is its own. A swap spends
        exactly one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        So <strong>Max</strong> is your largest single note, not your whole
        balance. When your balance is in several parts, the app says how much
        one swap can take. Swap the rest in a second swap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swap less than a note and the app first sets that part aside in a note
        of its own, privately and through the relay. The rest stays in your
        private balance. The app picks the note that matches your amount
        exactly, or else the smallest one that covers it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="costs">What it costs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vault fee, 0.25% of the amount you swap.</strong> A swap takes
          the note out of the vault the same way a cash out does, so the vault
          keeps its usual cash-out fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Price buffer, 0.5% on Robinhood Chain and 0.1% on Tempo.</strong>{" "}
          The swap asks for a little less than the quote, so a small price move
          before it lands does not make it fail. Whatever the trade does not use
          goes to the Gloam treasury.
          {NEW_CHAINS.length > 0 && ` On ${and(NEW_CHAINS)} it is 0.1% between two dollar stablecoins and 0.5% otherwise.`}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pool fees</strong> are already in the quoted price.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network fee:</strong> the relay pays it.
          {V3_ETHEREUM &&
            " On Ethereum that sets a smallest swap: a swap's vault fee has to cover its gas. The swap tab shows the smallest one right now, and it moves with gas."}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Open <strong>Details</strong> under the rate to see each part before
        you swap: what you receive, the vault fee, the price buffer, the route,
        and who sends it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount shown is the least you get. The quote refreshes every 15
        seconds, and the app prices the swap once more just before it goes. If
        the price moved your way, you get the better amount. If it moved
        against you by more than the buffer, the swap does not go through and
        nothing moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beta deposit limits apply to what lands, because the new note is a
        deposit. One swap brings in at most 50,000 of a stablecoin, or 2,500,000
        $GLOAM, and only while the vault has room under its total.
        {V2 &&
          " Every other token has its own limits, and a token the vault does not take yet can't be swapped into. A swap also spends no more than its refund could bring back in one deposit, so a larger part of your balance is split first."}
      </p>

      {NEW_CHAINS.length > 0 && (
        <>
          <h2 id="stablecoins">Stablecoin pairs on {and(NEW_CHAINS)}</h2>
          <p>
            Two stablecoins can be far apart for a moment, and a pool can hold
            far less than it looks like. A pool that runs out of liquidity at
            the market price keeps filling at a worse one, so the app checks
            each quote before it shows it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>A thin pool is refused.</strong> A swap that would move
              its pool by more than 2% doesn&apos;t go, and the app names a size
              that would. From 1% it warns. EURC&apos;s pool on Base is thin, so
              large EURC swaps there are refused.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Two dollars stay close to a dollar.</strong> Below 98 cents
              on the dollar, before fees, the quote is refused. From 99.5 cents
              the app says so.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The route is picked by what it pays.</strong> If the direct
              pool is one-sided, the swap goes through another stablecoin. USDT to
              USDG on Ethereum goes through USDC for this reason.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </>
      )}

      <h2 id="refund">If a swap can&apos;t finish</h2>
      <p>
        Once a swap is sent, its proofs are public. Anyone can copy its first
        step, the release from the vault, and send it on its own. That makes
        the swap fail on purpose. It cannot send your money anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is why. The escrow address is worked out from everything the swap
        must do: the note spent, your new note, a refund note and the route.
        Only the router can open it, and only to put the money back into the
        vault for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the money comes back to your private balance as a refund note, made
        in advance with the swap. You get back 99% of the note. The other 1%
        covers the vault&apos;s cash-out fee (0.25% today), and what is left of
        it goes to the Gloam treasury. The app finishes the refund by itself,
        through the relay, the next time it syncs your balance.
        {NEW_CHAINS.length > 0 && ` On ${and(NEW_CHAINS)} the refund is the note less the vault's fee and 0.1%.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        If a swap simply doesn&apos;t go through, for example because the price
        moved past the buffer, nothing moved and your money is safe in the
        vault. About a minute later the app moves it to a fresh private
        balance, through the relay. Then get a new quote. If you close the app
        first, the move finishes the next time you open it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, a swap that didn&apos;t go through isn&apos;t cancelled. Its
        proofs stay valid, so anyone can send it again, and it lands if the
        price comes back within the buffer. It can only land exactly as you
        made it: the same output, into your new note. The app keeps that note
        until the chain settles it and counts it the moment it lands. That move
        ends the old swap for good, and so does spending the same money on
        anything else, such as a send.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the app never hears how a swap ended, it waits an hour. If nothing
        has landed by then, it makes the same move. Only one of the two can
        ever land, so your money is counted once either way.
      </p>
      {V3 && (
        <p>
          A swap through the newest routers carries a deadline, 30 minutes after
          it is made{NEW_CHAINS.length > 0 && `, or 10 on ${and(NEW_CHAINS)}`}. It can&apos;t land after that. A refund and an exit have no
          deadline.
        </p>
      )}

      {V3 && (
        <>
          <h3 id="exit">If the vault can&apos;t take the refund</h3>
          <p>
            A refund note is a deposit, so it needs room under the vault&apos;s
            limit for that token. If there is none, the money waits at the
            escrow. It stays yours, the app shows it as held, outside your
            balance, and it comes back privately by itself once there is room.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don&apos;t have to wait. Each swap names a one-time exit key, made
            from your refund note&apos;s secret, so only you can use it. Sign for a
            wallet and everything that arrived at the escrow goes there, and a
            copy of your signature can only pay that wallet. The relay can send
            it for you, so a new wallet needs no gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An exit is public.</strong> Anyone can see that wallet and the
            amount next to the swap, so that money stops being private. A wallet
            you have never used keeps the rest of your balance apart from it.
            A swap made through an earlier router has no exit: its refund waits
            for room.

          <strong>Exact output or nothing.</strong> The router checks that it
          got the full amount of your new note and paid no more than arrived
          from the vault. Otherwise the whole swap reverts.

          <strong>The vault is unchanged.</strong> The mainnet vault still has
          no swap code. The router uses only its normal calls: release a note
          with a proof, and deposit with a proof.
