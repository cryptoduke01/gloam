/**
 * Payee sweep self-test: an x402 payment is final only after the payee moves
 * the received note into a fresh note only it knows.
 *
 * Runs against an in-memory pool that enforces what ShieldPoolPoseidon.transfer
 * enforces (known root, nullifier spent once, fresh commitments, insert both
 * outputs), with a mocked submitter. Covers the happy path, a payer who spends
 * the note back first, a payer who front-runs the sweep, a payment that never
 * landed, a replayed header, relay failures, and a sweep that landed while its
 * receipt was lost. When the transfer artifacts are present it also proves the
 * zero-change sweep with snarkjs and verifies it against the transfer vkey.
 *
 * Run after build:  node test/sweep.selftest.mjs
