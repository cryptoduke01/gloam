/**
 * x402 private-payment self-test.
 *
 * Drives the full agent-payment rail locally, offline, with a stub prover and an
 * in-memory tree: a server prices a resource (402 requirements), an agent builds
 * a private payment of the required amount to the payee, and the server verifies
 * the payment binds the required amount + asset and settles through the right
 * pool. The payment note travels sealed to the payee's receive tag, so the
 * server opens it with its receive key before verifying. Also checks the
 * issuer-scoped compliance disclosure shape and the explicit Gloam-vs-Zone
 * posture. No chain, no broadcast.
 *
 * Run after build:  node test/x402.selftest.mjs
