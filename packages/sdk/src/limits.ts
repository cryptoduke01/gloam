/**
 * Beta deposit limits, read live from the vault.
 *
 * Each payments vault caps one deposit (perDeposit) and the running total of
 * each asset (total) while depositLimitsOn is true. The owner changes them
 * through the vault's timelock, so a limit built into this package goes stale
 * the day a change lands. This reads them from the vault instead:
 * depositLimitsOn(), depositLimit(asset) and deposited(asset).
 *
 * When the read fails (an RPC down, a reader on the wrong chain), nothing is
 * refused here: the vault enforces its own limits, and a deposit over one
 * reverts on chain with nothing lost but gas.
 *
 * A limit set to type(uint128).max is how the owner lifts it: it reads as no
 * limit (isNoLimit), never as a number to show.
