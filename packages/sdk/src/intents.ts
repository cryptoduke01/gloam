/**
 * Canonical Gloam intent shapes — the contract of record shared by the app,
 * the SDK, and the @gloam/mcp agent server.
 *
 * An intent has two layers:
 *   plan  — portable, USD/symbol-denominated, no secrets (matches MCP plan_*).
 *   exec  — resolved on-chain call (wei, addresses, proof args). Optional; built
 *           by the SDK's pure witness/prover helpers. Never carries a secret in
 *           a form that leaves the owner's environment.
 *
 * Public-input orderings below are pinned to the deployed verifiers and MUST NOT
 * drift — they are asserted against ShieldPoolPoseidon and the circom circuits.
