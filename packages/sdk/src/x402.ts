/**
 * Gloam x402: private agent payments over the HTTP 402 flow.
 *
 * x402 lets a server answer a request with 402 Payment Required, describe what
 * it costs, and accept a payment header on the retry. The winning Colosseum
 * pattern (MCPay) paired x402 with stablecoins to monetize agent tool calls,
 * but that settlement is fully public: amount, sender, and recipient all leak.
 * Gloam's scheme keeps the settlement private.
 *
 * Scheme "gloam-private" is settle-then-prove and self-custodial:
 *   1. Server answers 402 with GloamPaymentRequirements (amount, asset, payTo).
 *   2. The agent builds a private send (transfer) of the required amount to the
 *      payee from a note it already holds, and broadcasts it ITSELF. No operator
 *      or facilitator ever holds the agent's key or funds.
 *   3. The agent retries with an X-PAYMENT header carrying the payment note plus
 *      the settlement tx hash. The payee opens the note to see the amount; the
 *      public sees only that a shielded transfer happened, never the amount or
 *      the parties.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a Tempo Zone. A Zone is operator-visible: the zone
 * operator sees every transaction inside it. Gloam is private from the public
 * AND from any operator; only the payer and the payee learn the amount, and
 * compliance visibility is opt-in per payment via a scoped disclosure (see
 * GloamComplianceDisclosure), not granted wholesale to an operator.
