/**
 * Agent commerce with commitments: pay privately, then put a checkable record
 * of the payment into a merkle root you already publish.
 *
 * Many economies (a game city, a marketplace, an agent network) already post a
 * root of their records on chain every night, and that root is how anyone
 * checks them. A Gloam payment fits into it like this:
 *
 *   1. The payer's agent sends a private payment from its private balance to
 *      the payee's receive tag (buildPrivatePaymentWithReceipt). It is a real
 *      vault transaction: transfer(proof, root, nullifier, [payment, change]).
 *   2. Once that transaction lands, the payer proves the payment with the
 *      receipt circuit (buildPaymentReceipt): "a private payment of `asset`,
 *      at least `minAmount` (or exactly `shownAmount`), is in the vault",
 *      bound to one reader and an expiry through `context` (proofContext).
 *   3. The economy hashes that into one bytes32 leaf (paymentReceiptLeaf) and
 *      puts the leaf into its nightly root next to its other records.
 *   4. Later anyone holding the record checks it (checkPaymentReceipt): the
 *      leaf recomputes, the proof verifies, the vault knows the root, and the
 *      named transaction created the payment note. Amounts and the payee stay
 *      out of the root; only the leaf is in it.
 *
 * The leaf, exactly (Solidity, or any language with an ABI encoder):
 *
 *   keccak256(abi.encode(
 *     string  "gloam.receipt-leaf.v1",
 *     uint256 chainId,
 *     address pool,
 *     bytes32 txHash,       // the vault transfer that created the payment note
 *     uint256[7] signals    // the receipt proof's public signals, circuit order:
 *                           // [root, commitment, asset, minAmount, reveal, shownAmount, context]
 *   ))
 *
 * abi.encode, not encodePacked. A uint256[7] encodes as seven words in place,
 * so passing the seven values one by one gives the same bytes.
 *
 * What this does not do, plainly:
 *  - No contract verifies receipt proofs on chain today. The vault verifies the
 *    shield, transfer and cash-out proofs it takes; receipt proofs are checked
 *    off chain with snarkjs and the published checking key (receipt_vkey.json),
 *    by checkPaymentReceipt, gloam.trade/verify or the partner API.
 *  - A receipt shows that a private payment of that asset and size was made
 *    by that transaction. It does not show who received it: the payer picks
 *    the payment note's key, so the payer and the payee can both make it.
 *  - If the payer's wallet signs the vault transfer itself, that wallet is the
 *    transaction's sender. The amount and the payee stay hidden; the fact that
 *    this wallet made a private payment at that time does not. Sending through
 *    the Gloam relay (relayIntent, relayMemo) keeps the wallet out of it.
 *  - Whoever sees a record sees its public signals (the asset, the minimum or
 *    the amount) and its transaction hash. Keep records off chain and publish
 *    only the root if those should stay private.
