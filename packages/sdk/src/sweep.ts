/**
 * Payee side of x402: make a received payment final.
 *
 * In the gloam-private scheme the payer builds the payment note, so the payer
 * knows its secret too. Until the payee moves the money, the payer could be
 * served and then spend the note back. The fix is a sweep: a private transfer
 * from the received note into a fresh note only the payee knows (the whole
 * amount, plus a zero-value change note). Once the sweep confirms on chain the
 * received note's nullifier is spent by the payee, and the money is the payee's
 * alone. If the payer already spent it, the sweep cannot land and the payee
 * refuses access.
 *
 * settleGloamPayment is the safe default for servers: open the sealed note,
 * verify it, sweep it, and grant access only when `final` is true. Chain reads
 * and submission are injected, so a server can sweep through its own wallet or
 * through the Gloam relay, and tests can run it against a mock chain.
