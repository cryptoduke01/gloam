const DESCRIPTION = `A worker that holds and moves money privately with Gloam, a shielded vault for stablecoins.
It can:
- show the agent's private balance and Gloam address
- add money from the agent's wallet to its private balance (a public deposit; spending from it is private)
- pay privately to a Gloam address (gloamr1.…), a Gloam payment request link, or by claim link for someone with no Gloam address
- receive: share its Gloam address, make a payment request link, pick up payments sent to it, or claim a claim link
- cash out from the private balance to a public 0x address (the cash out itself is public)
- prove it holds at least an amount privately, for one named reader, without showing the balance
- check a Gloam proof someone sends it
Every payment and cash out must fit the owner's per-asset limits; a refusal says why. Amounts are plain numbers in the asset's units (25 means 25 USDC).`;
