/**
 * Spending limits: the policy half (pure, no I/O).
 *
 * The same model as the Gloam MCP server (mcp/src/policy.ts): the agent's
 * owner decides which actions may move money, which assets, how much per
 * payment and per rolling 24 hours, who may be paid, and a date after which
 * nothing moves. Every function that moves money checks the policy before it
 * signs anything, and no policy means no spending.
 *
 * Two differences, on purpose. First, every cap belongs to one asset. The MCP lets a
 * pair of agent-wide caps stand in for each asset, and caps count in each
 * asset's own units, so "50" next to USDC and ETH meant 50 USDC and 50 ETH (a
 * finding from the Base audit). Here an agent-wide number is refused with the
 * reason, and each asset carries its own maxPerPayment and maxPerDay. Second,
 * the caps bound money leaving the agent (payments and cash outs). Adding to
 * its own private balance only has to be an allowed action on a listed asset;
 * it is not capped and does not count against the day, so an ACP provider that
 * adds its earnings privately does not use up its payout budget.
 *
 * Assets are matched by chain and contract address, never by a symbol someone
 * else wrote, and amounts are compared in raw units with each asset's real
 * decimals.
 *
 * Honest scope: the limits are enforced by this plugin, off-chain. The vault
 * contract does not know them. They bind the agent because the agent can only
 * move money through these functions; whoever holds the key outside them is
 * not bound.
