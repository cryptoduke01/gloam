# Gloam

**Thesis: Stablecoins are becoming how businesses and AI agents pay each other, and every one of those payments is public. Gloam makes them private, and lets the payer prove exactly what someone needs to see.**

Tagline: private by default, provable on demand. Hero line: private money on public chains.

- Lead with stablecoin payments, payroll and agent payments, on four mainnets (beta): Robinhood Chain and Tempo since 21 October 2026, Base and Ethereum since 26 October 2026, with the testnets next to them.
- Why the tech fits: a payment has one owner, so the owner proves it on their own device with zero-knowledge proofs and nobody else holds a key. Committee systems (Zama FHE, Arcium MPC) and operator systems (Tempo Zones) suit shared secrets, not single-owner payments.
- Not new cryptography: the Zcash-lineage pool. New, as far as our research found: the payroll total proof, proofs scoped to one reader with an expiry (`context` input), and private payments for agents (MPP method proposal, x402, MCP with spending limits).
- Stock tokens: Robinhood Chain testnet only, held and sent privately there. Private swaps are live on Robinhood Chain and Tempo mainnet: a swap goes from the private balance through a one-time escrow to a public DEX and back. Who swapped stays private; the pair and the amounts are public. The old sealed trade stays retired.
- Never claim "first" or "only". Mainnet is live in beta: say it has beta deposit limits, was reviewed internally (20 October 2026) and that Kann Audits reviewed the vault contracts (report, 1 November 2026) and found no Critical, High or Medium issues. Never say "fully audited", "audited and safe" or "audited protocol", never imply the routers, circuits, app or relay were covered, and never say its findings are fixed. Never say a swap hides its amounts, or call it anonymous or untraceable. $GLOAM: facts only (a mainnet pool asset on Robinhood Chain; half of Gloam's fees buy it back). Say "no admin withdraw, timelocked rule changes", not "no admin" or "trustless".
- Comparison and honest gaps: `/docs/compare`, `/docs/privacy-model`, `/docs/production`. Every address on every network, read live and as a CSV: `/verify#contracts` (from `app/src/lib/contractDirectory.ts`).

## Canonical

- Domain: `gloam.trade` (single host)
- Docs: `gloam.trade/docs`
- Whitepaper: `gloam.trade/whitepaper`
- Pitch deck: `gloam.trade/pitch` (source `app/public/pitch/index.html`; `pitch/gloam-deck.html` is a repo copy, keep them in sync)
- Product: `gloam.trade/app`, mainnet and testnet in one app, switched in-app (future testnet host: `testnet.gloam.trade`)
- X: `@gloamtrade`
- Vercel: one project, Root Directory = `app`
- Contracts: `contracts/` (Foundry). Mainnet: `ShieldPoolPayments` (payments only) on Robinhood Chain mainnet (`4663`), Tempo mainnet (`4217`), Base mainnet (`8453`) and Ethereum mainnet (`1`). Testnet: `ShieldPoolPoseidon` on Robinhood Chain testnet (`46630`) and Tempo Moderato testnet (`42431`)
- Mainnet vaults (no admin withdraw, 3-day timelock on rule changes): Robinhood Chain `0x39e28cde55cab798874746ac52cb4b5cc99a0194` (deploy block `94194599`), Tempo `0x39e28cde55cab798874746ac52cb4b5cc99a0194` (deploy block `45172561`), Base `0x39E28Cde55CAB798874746ac52cb4B5Cc99a0194` (deploy block `53109632`), Ethereum `0x39E28Cde55CAB798874746ac52cb4B5Cc99a0194` (deploy block `26276183`). PoseidonT3 on all four: `0x1a32C2c2A77225EC2dD3BF7be1018819b1039Cb4`. Owner `0x76b7E410a227c888aBD2Bdc24Ee32E094B0FD4D8` (one wallet at launch, multisig planned); treasury `0xB3900ac9350903218e4c7597bAb0f008F01B30B8` (cash-out fees since 24 October 2026); relayer `0xb1E994586E62994648a0b866BF33F2EDd942512e` (Gloam team runs it; it cannot move or redirect money)
- Base: Base Sepolia (`84532`) is live as a testnet since 24 Oct 2026 (vault `0x39e28cde55cab798874746ac52cb4b5cc99a0194`, deploy block `49802958`; memo board `0x01B3172d9900Cb26d57E986429b9b23854c74598`; `contracts/deployments/base-sepolia.json`). Base mainnet (`8453`) is live since 26 Oct 2026 (memo board `0xfCa1887e77f738ef9C5751974b3f3873d029F2DC`; `contracts/deployments/base-mainnet.json`), in `MAINNET_POOLS[8453]` (`app/src/lib/mainnet.ts`, `packages/sdk/src/mainnet.ts`). Both are `ShieldPoolPayments` on the final keys with beta limits (USDC, EURC, ETH; USDT on mainnet). Runbook `DEPLOY-BASE.md`. Base Sepolia is a testnet that sets `ceremony: "production"` and `paymentsPool: true`.
- Ethereum: Ethereum mainnet (`1`), live since 26 Oct 2026 (memo board `0x8699D015087dE6D25d55d5ceB63b34b9d773f135`; `contracts/deployments/ethereum-mainnet.json`), `ShieldPoolPayments` on the final keys with beta limits (USDC, USDT, USDG, PYUSD, EURC, ETH); its testnet is Ethereum Sepolia, below. Runbook `DEPLOY-ETHEREUM.md`. In `MAINNET_POOLS[1]`. The relay has a gas ceiling there (`lib/relay/gasCeiling`, 3 gwei by default): over it nothing is sent (`gas_high`) and scheduled cash outs wait. USDT on Ethereum needs a stale allowance set to 0 before a new approval.
- Ethereum Sepolia (`11155111`, key `ethereum`): a testnet like Base Sepolia (`ShieldPoolPayments`, final keys, beta limits; USDC, USDG, PYUSD, EURC, ETH). Live since 2026-10-25: vault `0x465EbfcdE1e384C7B1e8388E1aFEA95438c7A0ef` (block 11992914) and memo board `0x8699D015087dE6D25d55d5ceB63b34b9d773f135` (block 11992942), in `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_POOL` (`app/src/lib/mainnet.ts`, `packages/sdk/src/mainnet.ts`; `contracts/ethereum-sepolia-after-deploy.sh` wrote both). Runbook `DEPLOY-ETHEREUM-SEPOLIA.md`. Reads go to publicnode, which is at the chain head; logs, receipts and state older than 9,000 blocks go to Tenderly's gateway, which keeps the whole history but trails the head by up to a few minutes (`app/src/lib/readTransport.ts`, the SDK's `gloamReadTransport`).
- Testnet vaults: Robinhood Chain `0x72406D9597807A46f730d8b4fDBC5aC45Dc1d740`. Tempo `0x841dc046ea3cc842ba3a855731472c6eb0f2d5eb`. Drainable, never use or seed: `0x4F38…12D8F` (audit H-P1). Never product-default `0xA488…`

## Live

Mainnet (final keys, beta deposit limits: 50,000 per deposit and 2,500,000 total per stablecoin, ETH on Base and Ethereum 20 per deposit and 1,000 total, $GLOAM 2,500,000 per deposit and 25,000,000 total) and the testnets (dev keys, test funds):

- Shield, private send, cash out, private payroll (one-off and scheduled), payment requests, the Gloam relay
- Mainnet assets: USDG, $GLOAM, PONS and CASHCAT on Robinhood Chain, with ETH, AI, ORBIO and GRIFT listed and opening as each deposit limit lands through the timelock; USDC.e, pathUSD, USDT0 and OUSD on Tempo; USDC, EURC, USDT and ETH on Base; USDC, USDT, USDG, PYUSD, EURC and ETH on Ethereum. Deposits and private payments are free; a cash out costs 0.25%
- Proofs of funds, payment and payroll totals, checked at `/verify`
- Agent payments over x402 and MPP, MCP server with spending limits
- Stock tokens held and sent privately on the Robinhood Chain testnet (testnet only)
- Private swaps from the private balance on the Robinhood Chain and Tempo mainnets (routers 0x34AB06208586A737Bf1607fa996Bc9162271c52d on Robinhood Chain, 0xfCa1887e77f738ef9C5751974b3f3873d029F2DC on Tempo); the old sealed trade stays retired
- App root: `app/` · never revive `docs.gloam.trade`

## Audits

- Internal: two rounds with fixes deployed, then the pre-mainnet review of 20 October 2026, closed with no Critical or High findings open. The multi-party ceremony is done (13 contributors, drand round 6561386, release `ceremony-final`).
- External: Kann Audits reviewed the vault contracts at commit `aac9e18` (report dated 1 November 2026; page `/security`, file `app/public/audits/gloam-kann-security-review-2026-11-01.pdf`, keep that path if it is reissued). No Critical, High or Medium issues. Findings are acknowledged and not fixed: changes land in the next vault. The swap routers, `GloamPayMemo`, generated verifiers, circuits, app, relay, MCP and SDK were out of scope. The finding counts live only in `FINDINGS` in `app/src/app/security/page.tsx`; other copy says "no Critical, High or Medium" and gives no total.

## Rules

- Real privacy (shielded balances, private txs). Never fake or mock success.
- **Public path** needs no Gloam contracts. **Private path** needs `contracts/`.
- Mainnet is the product (beta); the testnets sit next to it. Call networks mainnet and testnet, with no glosses (no "real money", "play money", "test money", "no real value" or "free practice"), and never let a mainnet path use dev keys.
- Two key sets: testnet verifiers hold the dev keys (`contracts/src/verifiers/*`, `app/public/circuits/*`), mainnet the ceremony's final keys (`contracts/src/verifiers/final/*`, `app/public/circuits/final/*`). Each network names its set (`GloamNetwork.ceremony`); a mainnet entry sets `"production"`. `script/KeyCheckProofs.sol` (regenerate with `node contracts/circuits/scripts/gen-key-fixtures.mjs`) proves which keys a verifier holds.
- Brand: monochrome with a green tint (`#2e7d53` light, `#8fd3ad` dark), Aeonik, light and dark. Calm, spacious, plain-language.
- Secrets server-side only.
- If it does not serve private payments for people, teams and agents on the chains Gloam runs on, it waits.
- Docs live in-app (`app/src/app/docs`). Do **not** create a separate docs project or `docs.gloam.trade`.
- Commit = commit + push to `main` for product work.
