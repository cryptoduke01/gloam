/**
 * Private swaps for the agent: quote one, make one, and finish one any way it ends.
 *
 * A private swap spends one whole note: it leaves the vault through a one-time
 * escrow, trades on a public DEX, and the new note goes back in, in one transaction
 * the Gloam relay sends. Who swapped stays private; the tokens and the amounts are
 * public. The planning, the checks and the proofs are the SDK's (swapIntent), the
 * same as the Gloam app's.
 *
 *   gloam_swap_quote           read only: the price, and anything that would stop the swap
 *   gloam_execute_private_swap proves locally and sends through the relay, under the
 *                              owner's limits ("swap" must be listed in tools)
 *   gloam_finish_swap          a swap whose money waits at its escrow: the refund, or the exit
 *
 * The rule that keeps the money: both notes a swap makes (the new note and the refund
 * note, which also holds the swap's exit key) are in the note store before anything
 * is sent, and the refund note stays there, dead if need be, as long as the swapped
 * note's unshield proof could still land. A swap is never sent from the agent's wallet:
 * that would put the wallet next to the swap on the explorer.
 *
 * A swap that went out and reverted, or ran out of time, leaves that proof public and
 * valid until the note is spent. So the note is held (moveFirst: no tool spends it) and
 * moved whole to a fresh note right away, with the same private send to this server's
 * own notes that splits a note (sendToSelf). A move that fails leaves it held, and each
 * refresh tries again (moveDue), as the Gloam app does. A swap whose send got no clear
 * answer and that shows nothing for an hour is treated the same way (SWAP_UNSEEN_MS).
