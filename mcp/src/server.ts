/**
 * The Gloam MCP tools.
 *
 * Gives an AI agent private execution tools across Gloam's networks: private
 * stablecoin payments on Tempo and private trading on Robinhood Chain. The x402
 * payment tools target either network (pass `network`), so an agent can settle a
 * 402 challenge privately in PathUSD on Tempo or in the RH asset on Robinhood.
 *
 * This exposes read + planning tools that work today, and returns honest
 * "intent" objects for write actions (shield / pay / send) when there is no
 * signer. It never fakes a private fill or settlement.
 *
 * Every tool that moves money (shield, public send, private pay) first passes
 * the owner's spending limits (src/policy.ts, src/spendGuard.ts): allowed
 * tools, assets, recipients, a cap per payment and per rolling day, and an
 * expiry. No limits configured means no spending. The limits are enforced here,
 * off-chain, not by the vault contract.
 *
 * The payment tools speak two 402 dialects with the same private settlement:
 * x402 (scheme gloam-private, X-PAYMENT header) and MPP, the Machine Payments
 * Protocol (WWW-Authenticate: Payment, method "gloam", intent "charge"; see
 * src/mpp.ts and docs/mpp/draft-gloam-charge-00.md).
 *
 * Note secrets never reach the agent. Notes live in an encrypted store inside
 * this server (src/noteStore.ts); tools hand out and take back short handles.
 * Payments are sealed to the payee's receive tag, and a payee settles a
 * received payment by sweeping it into a fresh note before granting access.
 * GLOAM_EXPOSE_NOTE_SECRETS=1 brings back the old secret-passing behavior; it is
 * unsafe and off by default.
