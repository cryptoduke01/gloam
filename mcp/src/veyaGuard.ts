/**
 * VEYA's budget check before a payment (optional, off by default).
 *
 * A Gloam note is spent with a proof, so wallet rules can't stop a payment: a
 * budget only holds before the payment, on the server that keeps the notes. With
 * GLOAM_VEYA_KEY set, every 402 this server is about to pay goes to VEYA first,
 * and the payment goes ahead only on an exact allow.
 *
 * What is sent: the operator's opaque agent id, the chain, the asset, the amount,
 * the payee, the resource's host and the payment request, with the key as a
 * bearer token. Nothing else: never a note, a secret, a balance, a wallet or a
 * signing key.
 *
 * It fails closed. A refuse, an answer this code does not know, an HTTP error, a
 * body that is not JSON, no answer within the timeout, or a setting that is
 * missing or unusable all mean: do not pay. VEYA's reason is untrusted text, so
 * only a stripped, capped copy of it goes any further.
 *
 * An allow carries a check id. With GLOAM_VEYA_ANCHOR_URL set, the payment's
 * receipt is bound to that id afterwards (veyaReceipt.ts), so an allow without a
 * usable id does not pay: a payment can't be undone, and without the id it could
 * never get its receipt. With receipts off the id is optional.
 *
 * VEYA is never told how a payment it allowed ended, so if one fails afterwards
 * its running budget can sit ahead of what was really paid.
 *
 * The format is as VEYA documented it on 1 Nov 2026 (backend 1.2.12). It is the
 * block below and nowhere else, so a change stays there.
