/**
 * The receipt of a payment VEYA allowed (optional, off unless
 * GLOAM_VEYA_ANCHOR_URL is set).
 *
 * VEYA's allow carries a check id. Once the payment lands, this proves it with
 * the receipt circuit, with that id as the proof's verifier, hashes the proof
 * into one bytes32 leaf, and sends VEYA the leaf to write to storeCommitment.
 * VEYA gets the leaf and the agent id, nothing else.
 *
 * The money has already moved when this runs, so it never throws and nothing it
 * does changes the payment. Its state lives on the payment's note in the note
 * store, saved before each step that can fail, so a failed receipt or anchor can
 * be retried. That state holds the full record, which shows the asset, the
 * minimum amount and the transaction hash: only the leaf and a status leave here.
 *
 * Two runs can reach one receipt: reading a mainnet vault's tree can outlast the
 * wait for the answer, so a retry can arrive while the first run is still going, and
 * two processes can share a note store. In one process the second run joins the
 * first. Across processes the store decides: see `advance`.
