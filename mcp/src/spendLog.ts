/**
 * The agent's spending log: a local JSON file the owner can read.
 *
 * Every spend is written as "pending" before it is signed, so the check and
 * the reservation happen together under a lock and two calls at once cannot
 * both squeeze under the daily limit. The entry is then settled: "sent",
 * "unconfirmed" (broadcast, receipt unknown), "reverted" or "failed" (nothing
 * moved). Pending, sent and unconfirmed count against the limit; refusals are
 * logged too, so the owner can see what an agent tried.
