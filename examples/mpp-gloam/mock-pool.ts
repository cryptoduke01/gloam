/**
 * A MOCK Gloam pool, in memory. It applies the same rules ShieldPoolPoseidon
 * applies to transfer(proof, root, nullifier, [c0, c1]): the root must be one
 * the tree has had, the nullifier must be unspent, both new commitments must be
 * fresh, and both are inserted. A successful transfer leaves a receipt with a
 * Transferred(nullifier, [c0, c1]) log, exactly what the real pool emits.
 *
 * Proofs are not checked here (run the demo with --real-proofs to generate and
 * verify real Groth16 transfer proofs). Nothing is broadcast anywhere.
